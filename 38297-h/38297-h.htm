<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE FALL OF THE LYDIAN EMPIRE.</h3>


<p>After the fall of Nineveh, Media, Babylonia, and
Lydia had continued to exist side by side in peace
and friendship. The successful rebellion of Cyrus
altered at one blow the state of Asia. He had not
been contented with winning independence for the
Persians; he had subjected Media to his power. In
the place of a friendly and allied house, the kings
of Lydia and Babylonia saw Astyages deprived of
his throne, and Media in the hands of a bold and
ambitious warrior. Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia
would hardly have allowed the sovereignty of the
table-land of Iran to pass out of the power of a near
kinsman into that of Cyrus without offering some
resistance; but he was no longer alive to prevent or
revenge the overthrow of his brother-in-law. His son
Evil-merodach had also come by his death before
Astyages succumbed to the arms of Cyrus, and after
a short reign Neriglissar left the kingdom to a boy
(III. 392). On the other hand, the Lydian empire
was in its fullest vigour. We are acquainted with
the successes which fell to the lot of Alyattes after
his alliance with Media; we saw with what rapidity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>his son Cr&#339;sus brought to a happy conclusion the
long struggle against the Greek cities of the coast.
His kingdom now embraced the whole of Asia Minor,
as far as the Halys; the Lycians alone remained
independent in their small mountain canton. Loved
and honoured by his people, as Herodotus indicates,
Cr&#339;sus saw his complete and compact empire in the
greatest prosperity; his treasury was full to overflowing;
his metropolis was the richest city in Asia
after Babylon. The Lydian infantry were excellent
and trustworthy; the cavalry were dreaded; in past
days they had measured themselves with success
against the Medes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Thus in the third or fourth
year of his reign, in the pride of his position, surrounded
by inexhaustible treasures and the most
splendid magnificence, on his lofty citadel at Sardis,
Cr&#339;sus could declare himself, against the opinion
of the Athenian Solon, the man most favoured by
fortune (III. 458). Two years afterwards Astyages,
whose wife Aryanis was Cr&#339;sus' sister, was overthrown.
Cr&#339;sus had reason enough to take the field
for his brother-in-law, and anticipate the danger which
might arise for Lydia out of this change in the East.
He might hope that his example would set the Babylonians
in motion against the usurper of the Median
throne, and cause the Medes themselves to revolt
against their new master. But he appears to have
been afraid of embarking in an uncertain and dangerous
war at a great distance from his own borders.
It was not clear that victory at the first onset would
imply lasting success, and Lydia had no attack to
fear so long as Cyrus was occupied in establishing
his new dominion in Media, and engaged in
conflicts in the East and North. In Sardis it might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
be assumed that the usurper would find great difficulties
in his way. Herodotus represents Sandanis,
a distinguished Lydian, as asking Cr&#339;sus whether
he would take the field against men who clad themselves
in leather, and did not eat what they liked,
but what they had, and lived in a rugged country&mdash;who
drank water and not wine, and had not even
figs or any other thing that was pleasant? What
could the king, if victorious, take from them, when
they had nothing? On the other hand, if conquered,
he had much to lose, and if the Persians once tasted
any of the good things of Lydia, they would never
be driven out of the land again.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Cr&#339;sus hesitated.
It was of the greatest importance for Cyrus that
Lydia and Babylonia should not interfere in favour
of Astyages and the Medes, that they remained
inactive during the revolution, and allowed him to
establish his dominion in Media without disturbance,
to direct his aim unimpeded against the neighbours
of Media, and to subjugate without opposition the
Parthians, Hyrcanians, and Cadusians.</p>

<p>The manner in which war eventually broke out
between Lydia and Persia, the course of the war, and
the fortune which overtook Cr&#339;sus, are narrated by
Herodotus in the following manner: "Solon had
scarcely left Cr&#339;sus (III. 454, note 3) when the latter
saw in a dream the vision which portended the fate
of his son. He had two sons: one was deaf and dumb,
but the other, Attys, was greatly distinguished above
all his companions. The dream told him that he
would lose this son by an iron spear-head. In alarm
Cr&#339;sus found a wife for his son, would not allow him
to go out with the army as before, and removed into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the armoury all the armour which was in the chambers,
that nothing might fall upon him. At the time when
Cr&#339;sus was occupied with the marriage of Attys, a
Phrygian came to Sardis, Adrastus by name, the son
of Gordius, the grandson of Midas, who had unintentionally
killed his brother, and had been banished
by his father, and Cr&#339;sus received him. At the
same time a great boar appeared on the Mysian
Olympus, which ravaged the lands of the Mysians,
and as they could not master it, they sent messengers
to Cr&#339;sus praying him to allow Attys and
some chosen youths to come with dogs to set them
free from the monster. Cr&#339;sus would not let his
son go, for he had just been married. But the son
complained to his father: Previously he had won
great glory in war, and in the chase, now he was
kept back from both; how would men look upon him
in the market-place?&mdash;in what light would he appear
to the citizens and his young wife? Cr&#339;sus told
him the dream, but Attys replied that the boar had
no hands, and no iron point: Cr&#339;sus therefore
allowed him to go, and bade Adrastus accompany
his son and watch over him. Adrastus promised to
bring back his son uninjured, so far as lay in his
power, in return for the kindness which Cr&#339;sus had
shown him. The boar was surrounded on Olympus,
and javelins thrown at it from every side; the spear
of Adrastus missed the boar and hit Attys. Thus
was the dream of Cr&#339;sus fulfilled. Adrastus went
with the corpse to Cr&#339;sus, and besought him to slay
him as a sacrifice to the dead. But Cr&#339;sus replied
that Adrastus had made recompense enough in condemning
himself to death. He had his son buried
with proper honours; but Adrastus slew himself on
the grave."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two years were spent by Cr&#339;sus in mourning
for his son. Then the destruction of the empire of
Astyages by Cyrus, and the growing power of the
Persians, put an end to the mourning, and caused
him to consider whether he could check the rise of
the Persians before they became great. With this
thought in his mind, he determined to test the oracles,
both those of the Greeks and that in Libya, and
ascertain whether they could tell the truth; to the
oracle which he found truthful, he would propose the
question, whether he should undertake a campaign
against the Persians. So he sent to the oracles of
the Greeks, to Miletus, Delphi, Abae, and Trophonius,
to the sanctuary of Amphiaraus at Thebes, and to
Dodona, to the temple of Ammon in Libya, bidding
his messengers inquire on the hundredth day after
their departure from Sardis, what Cr&#339;sus, the son of
Alyattes, the king of Lydia, was doing on that day.
The answers were to be written down, and brought
back to him. What the other oracles said no one
has narrated, but when the Lydians came into the
temple at Delphi and propounded their question,
the priestess answered: 'I know the number of the
sand, and the measure of the sea; I understand the
dumb, and hear him who speaks not. The scent
of the hard-shelled tortoise comes into my nostrils
which is being cooked in brass with lamb's flesh; brass
is below, and brass is above.' The Lydians wrote
this down, and returned to Sardis; and when the other
messengers came back, Cr&#339;sus opened their letters.
He paid no attention to the rest, but when he came
to the answer from Delphi he recognised the power
of the god, and saw that the Delphic oracle alone had
been aware of what he was doing. For on the day
appointed he had cooked the flesh of a tortoise and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
lamb in a brazen vessel, covered with a brazen lid,
thinking that it would be impossible to discover or
invent such a thing. What answer was brought back
from Amphiaraus I cannot say, for it is nowhere
recorded, but Cr&#339;sus is said to have considered this
oracle as truthful. Then Cr&#339;sus won the favour of
the god of Delphi by great sacrifices. He offered
3000 victims of every kind, and erected a great pile
of wood on which he burned couches covered with
gold and silver, golden goblets, purple robes and
garments, in the hope that he would thereby gain the
favour of the god yet more, and bade the Lydians
sacrifice to their deity whatever each possessed. And
as the sacrifice left behind an enormous mass of
molten gold, Cr&#339;sus caused bricks to be made, six
palms in length, three in breadth, and one in depth;
in all there were 117 bricks. Of these, four were of
the purest gold, each two and a half talents in
weight; and the rest of white gold (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of mingled
gold and silver), each two talents in weight. In
addition, there was a golden lion which weighed ten
talents. When these were finished, Cr&#339;sus sent
them to Delphi, and added two very large mixing-bowls,
one of gold, weighing eight talents and a half
and twelve min&aelig;, and one of silver, the work of
Theodorus of Samos, as the Delphians say, and I
believe it, for it is the work of no ordinary artificer;
four silver jars, and two vessels for holy water, one
of gold and the other of silver, circular casts of
silver, a golden statue of a woman, three cubits high,
and the necklace and girdles of his queen. All these
things he sent to Delphi, and to Amphiaraus a golden
shield and a spear, of which both the stem and the
point were of gold."</p>

<p>"Cr&#339;sus bade the envoys who carried these gifts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
ask the oracles, whether he should march against the
Persians, or collect allies. The answer of both oracles
was to the same effect: they told him, that if he
went against Cyrus he would destroy a great empire,
and at the same time advised him to find out who
were the most powerful among the Greeks, and take
them as allies. Cr&#339;sus was greatly delighted when
he received this answer; in the certainty that he
would overthrow the empire of Cyrus, he sent again
to Delphi and presented each Delphian with two
staters. The Delphians in return bestowed on the
Lydians for all future time the right to consult the
priestess first, the best seats, freedom from contributions,
and the citizenship of Delphi to any Lydian
who should wish to become a Delphian. Cr&#339;sus
inquired of the oracle for the third time: whether his
reign would be of long continuance, and the priestess
replied: 'When a mule becomes king of the Medes,
then, O soft-footed Lydian, fly from the pebbly Hermus;
stay not, and take no shame to be a coward.'
Then Cr&#339;sus was yet more delighted, for he thought
that a mule would never rule over the Medes instead
of a man, and therefore neither he nor his descendants
would lose their power. Then he inquired who were
the most mighty among the Hellenes, and when he
found that the greatest part of the Peloponnesus was
subject to the Laced&aelig;monians, he sent messengers
with presents to Sparta to conclude an alliance. The
Laced&aelig;monians were filled with joy; they knew the
oracle which had been given to Cr&#339;sus, and made
him a friend and ally, as they had previously received
many kindnesses at his hands."</p>

<p>"Cr&#339;sus now marched to Cappadocia in the hope
of crushing Cyrus and the Persians; he also intended
to add Cappadocia to his kingdom, but above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
all he wished to take vengeance on Cyrus, who
had defeated his brother-in-law Astyages, and had
got him in his power. When he came to the Halys,
which was the boundary between the Lydian and
the Persian kingdoms, he crossed the river by the
bridges, and came into the part of Cappadocia, which
is called Pteria (this region, the strongest in the
whole country, lies towards Sinope and the Pontus
Euxinus). There he pitched his camp, desolated the
land, took the city of the Pterians, and enslaved the
inhabitants, conquered the neighbouring cities, and
drove out the Syrians, who had done him no harm
whatever. But Cyrus collected his army, adding to
it all the nations in his march, and took up a position
against Cr&#339;sus. Previous to setting out, he had
sent heralds to the Ionians, and requested them to
revolt from Cr&#339;sus. To this request the Ionians did
not listen. Then Cyrus encamped opposite Cr&#339;sus,
and the two armies tried their strength in the land
of Pteria. A fierce battle was fought; many fell on
both sides; neither was victorious, and when night
came they desisted from the battle. Cr&#339;sus found
that his force was not strong enough; his army was
inferior in numbers to that of the enemy, and when
Cyrus did not venture to attack him on the next day,
he returned to Sardis. His object was to summon
the Egyptians, for he had made a treaty with Amasis
the king of Egypt before entering into terms with
the Laced&aelig;monians, to send to the Babylonians&mdash;for
with them also and their king Labynetus he had
made an alliance&mdash;and to call on the Laced&aelig;monians
to join him at a fixed time. After uniting these,
and collecting all his forces, he intended, as soon as
the winter was over, to march out against the Persians.
So when he arrived at Sardis he sent heralds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to his allies, bidding them assemble in the fifth
month at Sardis, and dismissed all the mercenaries
in the army which had fought against Cyrus. He
did not expect that Cyrus, who had contended in
the battle without success, would march against Sardis.
When Cr&#339;sus retired immediately after the battle in
Pteria, and it was discovered that the Lydian forces
were to be disbanded, Cyrus saw that it would be
much to his advantage to march upon Sardis with all
speed, before the Lydian army could be collected a
second time. He was so rapid in his movements, that
he announced his own arrival to Cr&#339;sus."</p>

<p>"Though in great difficulties, inasmuch as things
had turned out contrary to his expectations, Cr&#339;sus
led out the Lydians to battle. And at that time
there was no braver and more warlike nation in
Asia. They fought on horseback, armed with long
lances, and were excellent riders. The armies met
in the large open plain before Sardis. The cavalry
of Cr&#339;sus caused alarm to Cyrus, and on the advice
of Harpagus the Mede, he collected all the camels
which carried the food and baggage of the army, took
off their burdens, and had them mounted by armed
men. These he placed before the army, then followed
the infantry, and after them the Persian horse. He
bade them not to slay Cr&#339;sus, even though he should
seek to defend himself when taken captive. When
the battle broke out, the Lydian horses were alarmed
at the sight and smell of the camels, and turned, and
so the hopes of Cr&#339;sus were destroyed. Yet the
Lydians did not lose their courage; they sprang from
their horses and met the Persians on foot. At length,
when many had fallen on both sides, the Lydians
fled; they were driven into the walls, and besieged by
the Persians. Cr&#339;sus thought that the siege would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
occupy a long time, and sent fresh messengers to his
confederates, and also to the Laced&aelig;monians, bidding
them come as soon as possible. When they arrived
at Sparta three hundred Spartans had been slain by
the Argives, yet they determined to send assistance;
their men were armed and ready to sail, when there
came a second message that Sardis was captured, and
Cr&#339;sus a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Sardis had been invested fourteen days when
Cyrus announced to his army that the man who first
climbed the walls should receive presents. Attempts
were made, but as they failed, they were given up.
Nevertheless Hyroeades, a Mardian, determined to
climb the citadel at a place where no watch had been
set. It was never supposed possible that the city
could be taken on this side, for the mountain fell
precipitously down towards Mt. Tmolus, and storming
was impossible. On the previous day Hyroeades had
seen a Lydian, whose helmet had fallen down, descend
after it, and then climb back with it. He also
ascended, others followed, and when sufficient Persians
were on the top, Sardis was taken and the whole city
plundered. After the citadel had been captured a
Persian rushed at Cr&#339;sus, whom he did not know,
to cut him down. When the dumb son of Cr&#339;sus
saw this, through fear and horror he broke out into
speech, and cried out: 'Man, do not slay Cr&#339;sus.'
And ever after he was able to speak."</p>

<p>"The Persians led Cr&#339;sus to Cyrus, who caused a
great pyre to be built, and Cr&#339;sus to be led to it
in chains with twice seven Lydian boys; whether it
was that he intended to offer the firstlings of the
victory to some god, and discharge a vow, or whether
he knew that Cr&#339;sus was eminent for piety, and
wished to see if a god would protect him from being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
burnt alive. When Cr&#339;sus was on the pyre, the
words of Solon came into his mind, in his distress,
that no one among living men was to be accounted
happy. When this occurred to him, he sighed deeply
after a long silence, and called out thrice, Solon!
On hearing this Cyrus commanded the interpreters
to ask Cr&#339;sus whom he was calling upon. At first
he was silent; on being pressed, he said: 'On him,
whose words I count it above great treasures that
all rulers should hear.' As what he said was unintelligible,
the question was put to him again, and
when they insisted on hearing the whole, he told
them, while the pyre was being kindled at the outer
edge, what Solon the Athenian had said to him. When
Cyrus heard this from the interpreters he reflected
that he, a man, was condemning to the flames a man
of no less power than himself; in fear of vengeance,
and considering that there was nothing certain among
men, he changed his mind, and gave orders to quench
the fire, and bring down Cr&#339;sus and those with him.
When all attempted in vain to quench the flames,
Cr&#339;sus, according to the Lydian account, called on
Apollo, entreating him to aid him now if he had ever
offered pleasant gifts, and save him in his extremity.
When Cr&#339;sus was praying in tears to the god, the
sky, which had been clear and still, was suddenly
covered with clouds; a storm burst upon them, and
the fire was quenched by torrents of rain. And Cyrus
then saw that Cr&#339;sus was a man beloved by the gods,
and asked him why he had marched against his land,
and made him his enemy instead of his friend?
Cr&#339;sus replied, that he had been induced to do this
by his own bad fortune and the good fortune of Cyrus.
The god of the Hellenes had urged him to take the
field against Cyrus. Then Cyrus caused the fetters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to be struck off him, and placed him near himself.
When Cr&#339;sus saw the Persians plundering the city,
he inquired of Cyrus: 'What is all this multitude
doing with so much eagerness?' Cyrus answered:
'They are plundering your city and treasures.' He
replied: 'They are mine no longer; it is your property
which they are plundering and sacking. The Persians,
courageous by nature, are poor; if you allow them to
plunder and carry off much booty, it may be that the
man who gains the most will rebel against you. If
it pleases you, do as I advise. Place your body-guard
at the gates, and bid them take from the plunderers
what they are carrying out, and tell them that a
tenth must be offered to Zeus. You will escape their
ill-will, and they will gladly obey you.' This advice
pleased Cyrus. He followed it, and promised Cr&#339;sus
to grant him a favour in return."</p>

<p>"The favour which Cr&#339;sus asked was this: Cyrus
must allow him to send the fetters, which he wore, to
the Delphic god, and ask whether it was his manner
to deceive those who showed him kindness. Cyrus
granted the prayer with a smile, and promised that he
would not refuse a further request. So Lydians went
with the fetters to Delphi, and asked the god whether
he was not ashamed to have urged Cr&#339;sus to make
war upon Cyrus, who had taken much spoil from him;
and at the same time they showed the fetters. The
priestess answered, as it is recorded, that even a god
could not escape his destiny; Cr&#339;sus was paying
the penalty for his fifth ancestor, who had seized a
throne which did not belong to him. The god had
endeavoured to bring it to pass that the punishment
should not fall on Cr&#339;sus but on his children, but
he had only been able to defer the capture of Sardis
for three years; let Cr&#339;sus know that he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
taken captive three years later than was ordained.
Moreover, the god had sent him help when on the
pyre. It was announced that he would destroy a great
empire if he went against Cyrus, but what empire
was not said. Nor had Cr&#339;sus understood the response
about the mule. Cyrus was the mule, the son of a
Persian father and Median mother, a subject and his
mistress. When Cr&#339;sus heard this, he saw that he
and not the god was in fault."</p>

<p>Only a meagre excerpt remains of the account
given by Ctesias of the conflict of Cyrus and Cr&#339;sus.
The king of the Sac&aelig;, Amorges, marched with Cyrus
against Cr&#339;sus and Sardis. When the Lydians were
shut up in the city, Cr&#339;sus, deceived by the portents
of the gods, gave his son as a hostage to Cyrus, and
when he subsequently sought to deceive him in the
negotiations, Cyrus caused the son to be slain before
the father's eyes. The mother, when she saw the
execution of her son, threw herself down from the
turrets of the walls. Then Cyrus, on the advice of
Oebares, caused wooden figures of Persians to be
placed on long poles and laid against the turrets, that
the Lydians might be filled with terror at the sight
of them. In this way the citadel, and the city itself,
was taken. Cr&#339;sus fled for refuge into the temple
of Apollo, where Cyrus caused him to be placed in
chains, but though seals were set on them, and
Oebares was commissioned to keep watch, the fetters
were three times removed from Cr&#339;sus in a miraculous
manner. Then those who had been put in
chains with him were beheaded, as though they had
conspired to liberate their king, and Cyrus brought
Cr&#339;sus into the palace and caused yet heavier chains
to be put upon him; but the fetters again fell to the
ground, this time amid thunder and lightning. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
length Cyrus liberated Cr&#339;sus, showed him great
kindness, and presented him with the large city of
Barene, near Ecbatana, which had been garrisoned by
5000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Polyaenus relates that Cr&#339;sus, after his defeat in
Cappadocia by Cyrus, withdrew his troops in the
night by a pass. This pass he then filled with a
quantity of timber, to which he set fire in order to
check the pursuit of the Persians. When the armies
met a second time for battle, Cyrus rendered the
numerous cavalry of the Lydians, in which they
trusted, useless by placing camels opposite them. Thus
they were at once put to flight, and trod down the
infantry, so that Cyrus was again victorious. At
Sardis Cr&#339;sus once more tried the fortune of battle.
As his Greek allies delayed their coming, he provided
the strongest and tallest Lydians with Greek
armour. The sight of the strange arms checked the
Persians. They were terrified by the sound of the
spears striking against the brazen shields, and the
glitter of the shields caused their horses to take
fright and turn. They retired, and Cyrus concluded
a treaty for three days with Cr&#339;sus, in which he
was to withdraw his forces from Sardis. But as soon
as it was night he turned his army again upon
Sardis, and attacked the city unexpectedly.  The
ascent of the walls by scaling ladders was successful,
yet Cr&#339;sus maintained the citadel and defended it
bravely in the deceptive hope that his allies would
arrive. Then Cyrus caused the relatives of those who
were with Cr&#339;sus in the citadel to be seized and
bound, and brought before the walls; and he announced
to their kinsmen on the towers that if the
citadel were given up the captives would be set at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
liberty, if not they would all be hanged. This induced
the Lydians in the citadel to open the gates. But
in another passage Polyaenus repeats the version of
Ctesias about the capture of the city. Cyrus caused
figures in Persian clothing, and wearing beards, with
quivers on their shoulders and bows in their hands, to
be placed on tall poles of equal length, and in the
night these were laid against the walls of the citadel
so that the figures rose above the wall. At break of
day Cyrus attacked the part of the city underneath
the citadel. The attacks were beaten off, but on
turning round some Lydians saw the figures above
the citadel, and thinking that it had been stormed by
the Persians, they fled, and Cyrus took Sardis by
storm.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In Xenophon the Persians and Medes are contending
against Babylonia. On the representation of
the king of Babylon that those two nations would
subjugate all the world, unless measures were taken to
prevent them, Cr&#339;sus marches out to aid the king,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
with an army of 40,000 horse, and about 150,000
light-armed infantry and bowmen. But the united
army of the Lydians and Babylonians, though it
reached nearly 60,000 cavalry and more than 200,000
infantry,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was defeated. Cyrus turned his steps towards
Lydia, and Cr&#339;sus collected a new army on the
Pactolus of Lydians, Phrygians, Paphlagonians, and
Lycaonians, who were joined by the Cilicians and
Cappadocians. The Egyptians and Cyprians came
on board ship; envoys went to Laced&aelig;mon to ask
for troops. With this army Cr&#339;sus marched to meet
Cyrus at Thymbrara. Here the battle took place.
Cyrus had placed two archers on each of the camels;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
these were ranged opposite the enemy's cavalry, and
even from a distance the Lydian horses sought to
avoid the camels; some turn round, others rear, and
press upon each other. So the Persians succeeded in
overthrowing the disorganised cavalry.  But the
battle had to be fought out with the javelin, lance,
and sword; the Persians were not victorious without
great bloodshed. Cr&#339;sus flies to Sardis, the Lydians
alone remain faithful, the rest of his army disperses.
Cyrus pursues him on the next morning, and at once
invests Sardis. In the very night after the camp was
pitched before Sardis, Chald&aelig;ans (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Gordy&aelig;ans,
Carduchians)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, and Persians climb the fortifications
where they seem to be steepest. They were led by a
Persian, who having formerly been the slave of one
on the watch in the citadel, knew the place where the
rocks could be climbed from the river. The Lydians
abandoned the walls, as soon as they saw the citadel
taken. Cr&#339;sus shut himself up in his palace, and
asked for quarter. Cyrus had him brought into his
presence, and said that it was not his intention to
abandon to his soldiers the richest city in Asia after
Babylon, but they must have some reward for their
efforts and dangers which they had undergone. Cr&#339;sus
replied that the sack of the city would destroy the
sources of wealth, the woven stuffs and industry of the
place; if it were spared the Lydians would gladly bring
the best of what they had, and in a year's time the city
would once more be in great prosperity. Then Cyrus
asked Cr&#339;sus how it came to pass that he who was
such a zealous servant of Apollo, and did everything
by his direction, had fallen into calamity. Cr&#339;sus
replied that he had brought upon him the aversion of
the god by putting it to the test whether his an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>nouncements
were true. He believed indeed that
he had appeased his wrath by rich presents of gold
and silver, and when he lost his youthful son he had
further asked how he could most happily pass the
rest of his life, and the god had answered, "By
knowing thyself, thou wilt live happily." He had
regarded this condition of happiness as a very easy
one; a man might have some difficulty in learning to
know others, but himself he could know quite easily.
"But I did not know myself," Cr&#339;sus continues in
Xenophon, "when I fancied that I was equal to you
in war; you are descended from the gods, from a
series of kings, and from your youth have been
exercised in brave deeds. My ancestor was a slave
who became king. Now I know myself." Cyrus
allowed him to retain his wife and daughters, gave
him servants and entertainment, and took him with
him wherever he went, either because he held the
advice of Cr&#339;sus to be useful, or because this seemed
to him the safest thing to do.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Only fragments have come down to us of Diodorus'
narrative of the fall of Cr&#339;sus; in some respects these
agree with the account of Herodotus; more frequently
they differ from it. He may have borrowed from
Ephorus.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Diodorus began with the death of Attys
by the javelin of the Phrygian Adrastus. Cr&#339;sus
at first threatens to have Adrastus burnt alive, but
forgives his offence when he offers his own life for
it. But he voluntarily slays himself at the tomb of
Attys. Diodorus then gives an account of the oracles&mdash;the
first, which Cr&#339;sus received at Delphi before
the war on behalf of his dumb son,&mdash;Cr&#339;sus was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
foolish in wishing to hear the much-desired voice of
his child; he would speak in a day of disaster&mdash;the
second, about the consequences of crossing the Halys;
the third, about the mule. Cr&#339;sus sent Eurybatus of
Ephesus with gold, apparently to Delphi, but in
reality to the Peloponnesus, in order to receive as
many Hellenes as possible into his pay; but Eurybatus
passed over to Cyrus, and revealed everything
to him. This act of treachery was held in such
detestation by the Greeks, that to his day a villain
was called Eurybatus. When Cyrus had reached the
passes of Cappadocia with his united forces he sent
heralds to Cr&#339;sus, to discover his forces, and to tell
him that Cyrus would pardon his former offences
and nominate him satrap of Lydia, if he would
appear at his gates and there proclaim himself a
servant like the rest. Cr&#339;sus replied that Cyrus and
the Persians would sooner endure to be his slaves,
as in former times they had been the servants of
the Medes; as regarded himself, he had never obeyed
the order of another person. When Cr&#339;sus had
been taken captive, and the flames of the pyre
quenched, Diodorus represents Cr&#339;sus putting to
Cyrus the question which we find in Herodotus
(p. 14), about the sacking of the city; Cyrus puts
an end to the plundering, and orders the possessions
of the inhabitants to be brought into the palace.
We are further told, that as the rain had suddenly
come down and quenched the flames, Cyrus regarded
Cr&#339;sus as a pious man. Moreover, he kept Solon's
saying in mind; he held Cr&#339;sus in honour, and made
him his adviser, regarding one who had associated
with so many wise men as being himself prudent
and able.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Justin's excerpt from Pompeius Trogus gives a
brief account of the fall of the Lydian kingdom.
When Cyrus had reduced the greater part of the
nations which had previously been subject to the
Medes, Cr&#339;sus, the king of Lydia, whose power and
wealth were then very great, came to the help of
the Babylonians. He was conquered and retired
into his kingdom. When Cyrus had settled his
quarrel with Babylon, he engaged in war with Lydia.
He easily put to flight the Lydian army, already
dispirited by the previous defeat. Cr&#339;sus himself
was captured. "But the less the danger of the war,
the milder was the use made of the victory. To
Cr&#339;sus was given his life, portions of his property,
and the city of Barka, where he lived a life, which,
if not that of a king, approached nearly to royal
magnificence."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The end only of the account of Nicolaus of
Damascus, containing the story of the intended
burning of Cr&#339;sus, has come down to us. Cyrus, we
are told, had great sympathy with the misfortune of
Cr&#339;sus, but the Persians insisted that he should be
burnt as an enemy. A great pyre was erected at the
foot of a hill. Cyrus marched out with all his army;
a great multitude of natives and foreigners gathered
together. When Cr&#339;sus and fourteen Lydians were
brought out in chains, all the Lydians broke out into
sighs and lamentations, and beat their heads, so that
the weeping and wailing of men and women was
greater now than it had been at the capture of the
city. This showed what affection Cr&#339;sus inspired
among his subjects. "They tore their garments, and
thousands of women ran weeping forward. Cr&#339;sus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
advanced without tears, and with a firm countenance,
and when he reached Cyrus he asked with a loud
voice that his son might be brought to him. This
was done. The son embraced his father, and said
with tears: 'Woe is me, my father. Of what avail
was your piety; when will the gods help us? Have
they granted me speech only to bewail our misfortunes?'
Turning to the Persians he said: 'Burn
me also; I am no less your enemy than my father.'
But Cr&#339;sus checked him with these words: 'I alone
determined on the war, and no one else of the
Lydians; therefore I alone must pay the penalty.'
When numerous servants of the Lydian women had
brought rich garments and ornaments of every kind
to be burned with him, Cr&#339;sus kissed his son and
the Lydians who were standing by, and ascended the
pyre; but the son raised his hands to heaven and
cried aloud: 'King Apollo, and all ye gods to whom
my father has done honour, come now to our help,
that the piety of mankind may not be destroyed with
Cr&#339;sus.' His friends could hardly restrain him from
casting himself on the pyre. But on a sudden Herophile,
the sibyl of Ephesus, appeared, and descended
from the height, and cried: 'Ye fools, what injustice
is this? Supreme Zeus, and Ph&#339;bus, and glorious
Amphiaraus will not permit it. Obey the truthful
sayings of my words, that the god may not visit your
frenzy with grievous destruction.' Cyrus caused the
oracle to be interpreted to the Persians that they
might desist from their purpose, but they set the
pile on fire with torches on every side. Then Cr&#339;sus
called thrice on the name of Solon, and Cyrus wept,
that he should be compelled by the Persians to do an
unrighteous act, and burn a king who was no less in
honour than himself. When the Persians looked on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Cyrus and saw his distress, they changed their minds,
and the king bade those who were near him put out
the fire. But the pile was on fire and no one could
quench it. Then Cr&#339;sus called on Apollo for help,
because his enemies wished to save him and could
not. From the morning the day had been cloudy,
but without rain, but when Cr&#339;sus had prayed,
dark clouds rolled up from every side, lightning
and thunder followed fast, and the rain poured down
in such streams that not only was the pyre quenched
but men could hardly withstand the storm. A
purple canopy was quickly spread over Cr&#339;sus, but
the Persians, terrified at the storm, the darkness,
and the panic which had come upon the horses
owing to the tempest, were seized with fear of the
gods. They thought of the saying of the sibyl and
the commands of Zoroaster, cast themselves on the
earth, and cried for pardon. From this date the rule
of Zoroaster, which had existed among the Persians
for a long time, not to burn their dead nor pollute
fire in any way, was strictly observed. Cyrus led
Cr&#339;sus into the palace, treated him as a friend, seeing
that he was a pious man, and bade him ask without
hesitation for any favour that he chose. Cr&#339;sus
asked that he might send his fetters to Delphi and
ask the god, why he had deceived him by his responses
and driven him into war, when he had sent
him such trophies; the messengers were also to ask
whether the gods of the Greeks paid no heed to the
gifts which they received. Cyrus granted this request
with a smile and said that he would not refuse
Cr&#339;sus even a greater favour; he made him his
friend, and when he left Sardis, restored his wives and
children, and took him as a companion. Some say
that he would have made him viceroy of Sardis, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
he had not been afraid that this would induce the
Lydians to revolt."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>We have already noticed how deep was the impression
made on the Greeks by the greatness and
splendour of the Lydian kingdom. Lydia was the
power of the East with which they first came into
immediate contact, the first Oriental court which
they had before their eyes. A king of Lydia had
subjugated the great cities of the coast; his wide
dominion, power, and wisdom were the admiration
of the Greeks; his glory and treasures excited their
astonishment; he had shown himself kindly and
gracious towards them, and sent the richest gifts to
their gods&mdash;and this king it was who fell by a sudden
overthrow from his splendid position. He succumbed
to a foreign and distant nation, whose name up to
that time was hardly known to Greece, and his fall
brought with it distress and mischief for the Greeks
of the west coast of Asia Minor. This sudden fall of
Cr&#339;sus was a striking event, and most disastrous for
the Greeks, the more striking owing to the unexpected
and rapid nature of the change. How could so
brave, wise, and religious a ruler fall from the summit
of fortune into the deepest distress, and come by a
mischance which brought disaster not only on himself
and his kingdom, but also on the Greek cities? How
could this be the result of an undertaking begun on
the authority of the god of Delphi? These questions
forced themselves on the Greeks of Anatolia, and
beyond the sea, and their legends were at pains to
solve the problem. In the mind of Herodotus the
solution was the punishment which sooner or later
overtakes every unrighteous act. Gyges, the ancestor
of Cr&#339;sus, had robbed the ancient royal family of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Lydians, the race of Sandon, of their throne. It was
the vengeance for this crime which overtook Cr&#339;sus.
It was a widely-spread and favourite story among the
Greeks, how Solon of Athens, unmoved by the successes,
the prosperity, and splendour of Cr&#339;sus, had
warned him in his proud citadel at Sardis of the
mutability of human things, and preferred to his
brilliant position as a sovereign the modest lot of a
life well spent in the performance of duty. We have
observed (III. 458) that this narrative is not without
some basis of fact. Could there be a more impressive
illustration of the saying of Solon than the fate which
had overtaken Cr&#339;sus? The tradition of the Greeks,
especially of the Delphian priesthood, was aware of
several oracular responses which had been given to
Cr&#339;sus. Herodotus' point of view led him to believe
that no one, though warned by portents, dreams, and
oracles, could escape the doom which hung over him.
In this fact lay the justification of the Delphian
oracle in regard to the prophecies given to Cr&#339;sus.
It had announced what was correct, but owing to
the blindness sent upon him by fate, Cr&#339;sus had not
been able to understand its meaning.</p>

<p>Guided by these views, Herodotus represents misfortune
as coming on Cr&#339;sus in one blow upon another
immediately after he had displayed the splendour
of his empire to Solon, and in foolish vainglory
had declared himself to be the most fortunate of men.
That Cr&#339;sus had two sons, one a youth of promise,
the other dumb, and that he lost the former in the
bloom of his youth, are facts mentioned by Xenophon
as well as Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A dream indicates to
Cr&#339;sus the death which is destined for his noble son;
and the means which he adopts to avert the death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
serve to bring it about. Adrastus, who first slays his
own brother, then the son of Cr&#339;sus, and at length
slays himself on the young man's grave, is called a
scion of the old Phrygian royal family of Midas and
Gordius; hence there is a close connection between
the fall of the Phrygian and Lydian houses. The
Greeks worshipped Nemesis Adrastea, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the doom
which none can escape, on the Granicus, and on a
mountain near Cyzicus.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the tradition of the
Lydians, Attys was their first king, whom Herodotus
calls the son of the god Manes; according to the
legend of the Phrygians and Lydians, he had been
slain by a boar.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> As we saw, the Phrygians
mourned each year for the death of Attys, who had
been carried off in the bloom of youth (I. 532).
When death had overtaken this son, Cr&#339;sus sent to
Delphi to ascertain whether his remaining son should
ever receive the gift of speech; and the answer was
returned that he would speak on a day of great
misfortune. Thus the prescience of the Delphic
priestess is brought forward in the most emphatic
manner.</p>

<p>The overthrow of Astyages caused Cr&#339;sus to
examine a whole series of oracles that he might
ascertain whether they knew what was hidden from
men, before he inquired whether he should march
against Cyrus. Before this examination, Cr&#339;sus had
sought and received many prophecies at Delphi, and
now he tests not this oracle only, but many others.
The mixture of belief and scepticism which would
give rise to such an examination is not in itself incredible,
but the manner in which the test is carried
out in the narrative of Herodotus, or rather of the
Delphian priesthood, is wholly beyond belief. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
frivolous question&mdash;what was the king of the Lydians
doing on a certain day&mdash;the drift of which was so
obvious, would certainly be left unanswered by any
oracle of repute which was believed to receive revelations
from the gods. If we consider the nature of
the Delphic prophecy, which claimed rather to announce
the responses of Apollo than to bring to
light the past or the future; the religious solemnity
of the ceremonies, which they who would consult the
oracle had to perform; the small number of the days
on which the priestess spoke, we may be quite sure
that the priests would have rejected the question.
Herodotus cannot give the answers of the other
oracles&mdash;not even the answer of Amphiaraus (which
is also mentioned in the account of Nicolaus), and
yet this oracle must have stood the test no less
than Delphi, for Cr&#339;sus sent presents to it, and laid
before it his second question. To Apollo of Miletus,
whose answer to the first question Herodotus does
not know, and of whom the second question is not
asked, Cr&#339;sus dedicates exactly the same gifts as
those sent to Apollo of Delphi after he had stood the
test. Hence it is quite clear that the supposed examination
of the oracles is merely a story invented
by the Greeks to glorify the Delphic shrine. Cr&#339;sus
fell, in spite of the splendid presents he had made to
the Delphic god, on whose advice he had acted; in
order to maintain the divine wisdom of the oracle
against this charge, it must be proved to have knowledge
of the most secret things. And it is true that
Cr&#339;sus had put the oracle to the test, though in
another manner, by following up the answer to his
question whether he should go against the Persians,
with a second question&mdash;whether his empire would
continue. The story how splendidly Delphi had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
stood the test then received an apparently certain
foundation in the hexameters about the lamb's flesh
and tortoise, which was subsequently manufactured
in Delphi in the name of the priestess.</p>

<p>The narrative of the campaign in Herodotus is
obviously intended to put Cr&#339;sus in the wrong, and
burden him with guilt of his own in addition to the
offence of his ancestor. Sandanis warns him in vain
(p. 5). Cyrus has done nothing to injure Cr&#339;sus,
and therefore Cr&#339;sus is the aggressor. He crosses
the Halys, invades the territory of Cyrus, in order to
conquer Cappadocia and avenge Astyages on Cyrus;
he causes the land of the Cappadocians to be desolated;
and Herodotus lays stress on the fact that this
nation was quite innocent. Guilt is followed by incapacity,
after the indecisive battle. Cr&#339;sus disbands
his army for the singular reason that it "was inferior
in numbers to that of Cyrus." He is then surprised
in Sardis; the citadel is naturally ascended in the
very place where in old days king Meles omitted to
carry the lion which was to make the walls of Sardis
impregnable, because he thought it unnecessary, the
place being inaccessible. (I. 561). Cr&#339;sus is saved
from instant death, because the deaf and dumb son
receives his speech on a day of misfortune, as Delphi
had announced. The son can not only speak, but
knows how to address his father by name. The
favour of the gods, who turn again to Cr&#339;sus when
he has expiated the guilt of Gyges and himself by
his overthrow, is shown in this miracle, and more
plainly still on the funeral pyre. The wisdom of
the Greeks, and of Solon, is set in the clearest light,
when Cr&#339;sus in his deepest distress, on the brink
of a terrible death, remembers the warning once
given him by Solon. If such a recollection forms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the most brilliant evidence of the insight of the
Greeks, it might also give the motive for the rescue
of Cr&#339;sus.</p>

<p>The occurrences on and at the pyre partake so
strongly of the miraculous that Herodotus himself
is puzzled. What reason could Cyrus, whose gentleness
Herodotus himself extols, have for condemning
Cr&#339;sus to a death by fire, and with him fourteen
Lydian youths? Herodotus knows that fire is a god
in the eyes of the Persians, and that corpses could
not be burnt.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He says: "Cyrus either wished to
offer first-fruits to some god, or to fulfil a vow, or
to ascertain whether Apollo would assist the pious
Cr&#339;sus." When narrating the astonishing incidents
which took place on the pyre, he drops the positive
tone, and continues the story with "the Lydians say."
The pyre is already kindled when the question is
asked by the interpreters, What is the meaning of
the cry "Solon"? Cr&#339;sus is at first obstinately
silent, then answers obscurely; and only after long
pressure tells of his meeting with Solon, which could
not be done very briefly if it was to be made intelligible
to Cyrus, and the narrative had to be
translated by the interpreters, as Herodotus himself
relates. Then Cyrus is seized with remorse for the
execution he has commanded, and the attempt is
made to quench the pyre. Impossible as all this is,
Cr&#339;sus at the last moment confesses that Solon is
right, and Solon's deep insight moves the heart of
the great sovereign of the Persians, and rescues the
once prosperous but now fallen king.</p>

<p>In his minute account of the cremation, which, in
his rhetorical manner, he connects with the recovery
of speech by the deaf and dumb son, Nicolaus of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Damascus felt difficulties like those in Herodotus.
The law bidding the Persians not to pollute fire, nor to
"burn the dead," is well known to him. He removes
the contradiction by representing the cremation as
taking place against the will of Cyrus, and remarks
that after this incident the regulation was more
strictly observed. In his story also the change is
made by the mention of Solon's name. When Cyrus
had ascertained what Solon had said to Cr&#339;sus, he
began to weep, and saw that he had done wrong, and
the pain of their king touches the heart of the
Persians. This movement is assisted in Nicolaus by
the sibyl of Ephesus; in which no doubt he follows the
legend of Ephesus; Cr&#339;sus had made large presents
to the temple of Artemis in that city (III. 451).</p>

<p>In Herodotus, as in Diodorus and Nicolaus, it is
the rain, by which the pyre is quenched, which causes
Cyrus to continue his gentle treatment of Cr&#339;sus.
Moreover, the excellent advice, which Cr&#339;sus with
immediate prudence gives, for putting an end to the
plunder of Sardis, and other matters in Herodotus, in
Diodorus, and Xenophon, co-operate in influencing
Cyrus to hold such a wise man in respect. Xenophon
knows, or at any rate says, nothing of the burning of
Cr&#339;sus. Ctesias knows nothing of it: in his account
miracles of another kind are vouchsafed to the imprisoned
Cr&#339;sus by Apollo in his temple; the triple
loosing of the bonds, and their final removal with
thunder and lightning, determine Cyrus to set him
at liberty and make provision for him.</p>

<p>Lastly, it was incumbent on Herodotus and the
Greek narratives to justify the Delphian oracle with
regard to the responses given to Cr&#339;sus. In Herodotus
and Nicolaus this justification is introduced and
pointed by the sending of the fetters, which Cr&#339;sus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
had worn, as the first-fruits of the promised victory
to Delphi, and the question whether it was the manner
of the Greek gods to deceive those who had done
them kindness. Following, no doubt, the legend of
the Delphic priesthood, Herodotus then gives the
defence of the priestess, that Cr&#339;sus had not rightly
understood the oracles,&mdash;though as we shall see, he
had understood them correctly enough. The priestess
further tells Cr&#339;sus, that he was destined to pay the
penalty for the offence, which his ancestor Gyges had
committed against Candaules, though the Delphic
oracle had sanctioned this crime and carried it out.
Then destiny has to bear the blame. No man can
escape his doom; the god of Delphi had deferred
the fall of Cr&#339;sus for three years, and saved him
from the flames of the funeral pyre. The god of
Delphi had thus announced the truth (to prove this
Cyrus is made the son of a Median mother), and had
shown his gratitude for the gifts of Cr&#339;sus by delaying
his overthrow, and rescuing him from the flames,
as Cr&#339;sus must himself confess. Xenophon dwells
yet more on the justification. Cr&#339;sus had placed
himself in the wrong with the god, by putting it to
the test whether he could tell the truth; then he
hopes that he has appeased him by rich presents,
but he misunderstands the further response of the god,
"that he will be happy when he knows himself," for
in descent, bravery, and generalship he holds himself
the equal of Cyrus. In Herodotus and Nicolaus the
gift of speech to the deaf and dumb son, the quenching
of the pyre,&mdash;in Herodotus also the delay of
destiny, and in Ctesias, the miraculous loosing of the
fetters,&mdash;are proofs that the dedicatory gifts of Cr&#339;sus
and his piety had not been in vain. They could
not avert his doom, but they had alleviated it; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
god of the Greeks, whom he serves, has at the last
saved him from the most cruel fate, and brought it
about that Cr&#339;sus ends his days, if not as a ruler,
yet in peace and dignity.</p>

<p>In spite of all the national and individual points
of view which mark Herodotus' account of the fall of
Cr&#339;sus, and the legends which he has woven into it,
and used for his own purposes&mdash;the fanciful colours
which stamp it as fabulous&mdash;it nevertheless contains
a nucleus of historical truth, and we can give it a
place before the rest as a narrative of facts. We
have seen above how suddenly the successful rebellion
of Cyrus put an end to the close relations between
Babylonia, Lydia, and Media; how Lydia was
touched by this change, how clearly the intervention
of Lydia was needed, and what reasons could induce
Cr&#339;sus to defer it. Cr&#339;sus was obviously brought
to abandon his delay by the successes which Cyrus
achieved in establishing his dominion over the Medes,
and extending it to North and South, but above all
by his conquests in the West and the advance of the
Persian border to the Halys. Herodotus' account
shows us very clearly that Cappadocia had become
subject to Cyrus. When, on a previous occasion,
the Medes reached the Halys, Alyattes, the father of
Cr&#339;sus, had taken up arms; was he to fall short of
this example, in the presence of a power which had
grown up more rapidly and threatened greater
danger than the Medes? As Herodotus told us, it
was his intention to attack Cyrus before he became
too powerful. We may conclude with certainty from
what Herodotus relates, that Cr&#339;sus did not hide
from himself the importance and difficulty of the
undertaking. Above all he sought to win the favour
of Sandon the national deity (I. 564). The Lydians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
offered large burnt-sacrifices to this deity, their sun-god;
on a huge pyre they burnt numerous victims,
gold and silver vessels, and costly robes in his honour.
Herodotus tells us that Cr&#339;sus bade the Lydians
sacrifice from their own stores on that occasion; hence
the great sacrifice, the gold of which Cr&#339;sus dedicated
to the god of Miletus and Delphi, was a national
offering, which Cr&#339;sus presented to Sandon. We have
already shown that the Greeks recognised in the sun-god
of the Lydians their own Apollo and Hercules,
while the Lydians found their solar deity in the Apollo
of the Greeks. When Gyges undertook to overthrow
the old royal family which claimed to spring from this
sun-god, and could not succeed in his attempt, an
answer was sought from the sun-god of Delphi. The
god of the Greeks then dethroned the descendants of
the Lydian deity. In the year 556 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Cr&#339;sus had
already sent to Delphi, and given dedicatory offerings
to the god of Delphi and to the Ismenian Apollo at
Thebes; and at the present time, when he had
resolved to enter on a severe struggle for his throne
and kingdom, he called to mind the god, to whose
oracle his house owed its position; he would now
receive by his favour both kingdom and crown. So
Apollo of Miletus and Delphi received silver and gold
which had been consecrated by the fire. The bricks
into which it was formed were intended to bear the
lion which was also fashioned out of the same gold&mdash;the
symbol of the burning sun, the image of the Lydian
god. The four golden bricks formed the uppermost
steps. The total amount of the gold dedicated at Delphi
and Miletus reached 270 talents. For the presents
at Miletus Cr&#339;sus used the property of Sadyattes,
which he had confiscated at the beginning of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
reign, dedicated, and applied as an offering.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> When
Cr&#339;sus sent the gifts to Delphi, he inquired of the
oracle, as Gyges had previously done. At this time&mdash;about
140 years before Cr&#339;sus&mdash;the question had been
who was to ascend the throne of Lydia; now the
question was, whether the descendant of Gyges would
maintain it in the conflict against Persia. The answer
of the priestess, which Aristotle and Diodorus have
preserved in metre,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;"That Cr&#339;sus by crossing the
Halys would destroy a great kingdom"&mdash;is genuine,
and was certainly given in the meaning that Cr&#339;sus
should undertake the war and would destroy the
kingdom of his opponent. The object of Cr&#339;sus
in asking the question was to know whether he
would be fortunate in his attack on Persia. If it
was the object of the priesthood to give a dubious
answer to this question, they could not possibly have
answered the further question&mdash;whether he should
take allies to help him,&mdash;with the command that
he must take the "most powerful of the Hellenes."
At that time the Spartans were beyond all question
the most powerful of the Hellenes. How could the
priests of Delphi, who owing to the close connection
in which they stood to Sparta were well aware that
the oracle would be a law to that state, send the
Spartans to defeat and destruction, if they foresaw
such a thing?<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> That at Delphi, owing to the impression
made on the Greeks by the power, greatness,
and splendour of the Lydian empire, the remote and
unknown Persians were underrated is quite probable,
and indeed sufficiently proved by the subsequent
embassy of the Spartans to Cyrus. The first response<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
did not entirely remove the doubts of Cr&#339;sus, so he
asked a second time&mdash;"whether his dominion would
continue long," and this question received a thoroughly
satisfactory answer, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> an answer which, in the
obscure form purposely adopted by oracles, deferred
the defeat of the Lydians to distant times, and
impossible conditions.</p>

<p>Cr&#339;sus had not waited for the oracle to provide
himself with sufficient support in his undertaking. Yet
it suited him to enter into negotiations with the
Spartans, who after a series of successful contests
against the Pisatae, Argos, and some cantons of
Arcadia, had obtained the foremost place in the
Peloponnesus. At an earlier time Cr&#339;sus had sent
the Spartans a considerable present for the erection
of a statue of Apollo, and their grateful feeling
towards him would certainly be strengthened by the
authority of the Delphian oracle, whose response was
known to the Spartans, as Herodotus expressly states
(p. 9). Even in Xenophon's account they declared
themselves ready to send auxiliary troops to Sardis.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Cr&#339;sus did not stop here: he sent Eurybatus to
obtain yet more troops in Hellas. Herodotus told
us that Cr&#339;sus was in league with Egypt and Babylonia
against Persia before he made the treaty with
Sparta. Amasis, king of Egypt, had determined to
support Cr&#339;sus, perhaps in return for the service
which Gyges had once rendered to Psammetichus,
when he sent soldiers to aid him against his fellow-princes,
the vassals of Assyria (III. 301). The attitude
of Babylonia must be decisive. If Lydia and Babylonia,
who were both equally threatened by the new
power, united in a firm military alliance, they might
hope to contend successfully with the prince of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Persians. At Babylon, after the accession of Nabonetus
in the year 555 <small>B.C.</small>, the royal power was again
in strong hands. According to Herodotus, there
was a league between Cr&#339;sus and Nabonetus against
Persia. Xenophon represents Cr&#339;sus as coming to
the aid of the king of Babylon. Justin states that
Cyrus was at war with Babylon when Cr&#339;sus attacked
him; Cyrus drove him back, came to terms with
Babylonia, and carried the war to Lydia. From all
this we may assume that Lydia and Babylonia were
united, and that they undertook the war against
Persia in common.</p>

<p>Cr&#339;sus then might consider that careful preparations
had been made for his enterprise, when in
the year 549 <small>B.C.</small>, and as we may pre-suppose with
certainty, in the spring of the year, he took the
field.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He crossed the Halys, and directed his course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to the commanding plateau of Pteria, which Herodotus
rightly regards as the strongest position in
those regions. He took Pteria, and the neighbouring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
cities, and laid waste the land, with the view no
doubt of making it impossible for the Persian army to
support itself. There he remained, either because he
shrank from going further, and seeking a decisive
conflict at a distance from his own borders, or because
he expected a diversion on the part of the Babylonians.</p>

<p>The attack of Cr&#339;sus was unexpected by Cyrus.
He was also engaged with another enemy. These
conclusions we may draw from the fact that it was
autumn according to Herodotus before the armies
stood opposite each other. Herodotus further remarks
that Babylon, the Bactrians, and the Sac&aelig; caused
Cyrus to return out of Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> By lingering in
Cappadocia Cr&#339;sus had given Cyrus time to collect
his army and add to it the troops of the countries
through which he passed on his march to the West.
With his usual circumspection he sought to avail
himself of the weak points in his enemy. He sent
ambassadors to the Greek cities subject to Cr&#339;sus,
on the West coast, to urge them to revolt that he
might raise up enemies in the rear of the Lydians.
Cr&#339;sus awaited the attack of the Persians in the
neighbourhood of the conquered Pteria. Herodotus
tells that the contest was severe. In spite of the
considerable superiority of numbers on the Persian
side, the Lydians did not give way. The battle was
not decided, when night came on. In truth the
victory was with the Lydians, whose bravery made
such an impression on Cyrus that he would not renew
the battle. But the timidity of Cr&#339;sus put in his
hands all the advantages of a victory. After the
bloody day it seemed better to Cr&#339;sus, as is the case
with men of weaker mould, not to risk everything,
but to put off the final decision; he thought it safer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to retire, in order to strengthen his army and so fight
with equal numbers. Under the supposition that
Cyrus would not venture to advance "as the winter
was at the gate," he retired to Lydia. He intended
to use the winter for collecting the forces of his
confederates at Sardis. He requested Nabonetus of
Babylon, the Laced&aelig;monians and the Pharaoh, to
embark their forces on the Syrian coast, the Laconian
Gulf, and at the mouths of the Nile, in time for them
to reach Sardis in the fifth month, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the early
spring. To the want of resolution which had suggested
the thought of retreat, Cr&#339;sus, when returning,
added another great act of folly. He disbanded "the
mercenaries" of his army (Alyattes had made use of
hired soldiers), bidding them come again to Sardis in
the spring, and returned home with the Lydians
alone. Such a series of blunders could not go unpunished
in the presence of a general like Cyrus. In
no case could he remain in the devastated country of
the Cappadocians. He must go either forwards or
backwards. To choose the latter was voluntarily to
abandon the advantages which the retreat of Cr&#339;sus
offered. Yet he did not content himself with slowly
following the unexpected retreat of the Lydians. He
appears to have been informed of the plans of Cr&#339;sus
by Eurybatus of Ephesus, whose treason is not only
mentioned by Diodorus after Ephorus, but alluded to
by Plato, Demosthenes, and Aeschines.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> By a rapid
march upon the enemy's metropolis Cyrus intended
to cripple the Lydian forces, hit Cr&#339;sus in the very
centre of his power, and bring the war to an end at a
blow. He came so quickly, that, as Herodotus says,
he announced his own arrival. The sudden appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>ance
of the Persian army in the neighbourhood of
Sardis completely startled and terrified Cr&#339;sus. He
retired in order to be able to place in the field a
number of warriors equal to the army of Cyrus, and
now he was compelled to shut himself up in the walls
of Sardis or fight with far smaller numbers than took
the field at Pteria. He chose the latter, and awaited
the attack on the plain of the Hermus, which was
large enough to provide a field for his excellent
cavalry.</p>

<p>Though he had a great advantage in his forces,
and in the consciousness of his superiority to his
enemy, Cyrus omitted no means for securing the
victory. He had experienced at Pteria the attack
of the Lydian horse, their superiority to his own
cavalry, in spite of the practice in riding which the
Persians underwent from their youth up, and the
excellence of the Median horse. To render useless
the attack of these horsemen, Cyrus caused the camels
which carried the baggage and supplies of his army to
be mounted, and placed them in the first line. This
arrangement is mentioned not only by Herodotus but
also by Xenophon.  No doubt the Lydian horse
would be frightened by the noise and unwonted aspect
of these animals. Though robbed of their best arm
and mode of fighting, the Lydians nevertheless resolved
to dismount and carry on the battle on foot. They
pressed courageously on the Persians, and could only
be driven into the gates of Sardis after a bloody battle.
Cr&#339;sus was now limited to the walls of his city, and
compelled to defend them. He hoped to be able to hold
the city till his confederates should come, to whom
on the approach of Cyrus he had sent with appeals
for immediate assistance. But on the fourteenth day
after the investment of the city, as Herodotus main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>tains,
Cyrus brought matters to a decision. Then the
Mardian climbed the steep rock on the Pactolus, on
which the citadel lay, at a place where no guard was
set, the citadel and city were taken, and Cr&#339;sus
became a prisoner. A picture at Pompeii exhibits
Cyrus before his tent, and Harpagus beside him, at
the moment when Cr&#339;sus is brought forward.</p>

<p>Herodotus' narrative of the ascent of the citadel of
Sardis is confirmed by a precisely analogous incident
which took place more than three centuries later.
Antiochus III. had besieged his brother-in-law Ach&aelig;us
for more than a year in Sardis, and in vain. All
hope of taking the city except by starvation was
given up, when Lagoras, a Cretan, observed that the
walls must be left without a guard where the citadel
and the city met. At this point the walls rose on
steep rocks above a cleft into which the besieged threw
from the towers their dead along with the carcasses of
beasts of burden and horses. As the birds of prey
when they had eaten the corpses settled on the walls,
Lagoras concluded that no guards were stationed there.
By night he examined whether it was quite impossible
to climb up and plant scaling-ladders there. When he
discovered a ravine by which this seemed practicable,
he acquainted the king. The necessary preparations
were made; in the night, towards morning, when the
moon had set, Lagoras with sixteen companions climbed
up the rocks; 2000 men were ready to support him.
The spur on which the wall lay was so steep that
even when the morning broke a jutting piece of rock
prevented the garrison from seeing what was going
on, and when Antiochus led his army against the Persian
gate the garrison went to meet them. Meanwhile
the assailants by means of two ladders scaled the
walls close against the citadel and opened the nearest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
door; the confusion which ensued put the city in the
hands of Antiochus after a short struggle. Yet Ach&aelig;us
maintained the citadel; by a secret steep and dangerous
path in the rear he was able to keep up a communication
with Ptolemy Philopator of Egypt, and
finally he attempted to escape by this means, but he was
betrayed and fell into the hands of Antiochus (213 <small>B.C.</small>).<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Cr&#339;sus determined not to survive the great overthrow
and sudden disaster which he had brought upon
Lydia by his campaign. The Lydians had become
the slaves of the Persians, but it might be possible to
appease the wrath of Sandon, from whom all this
misfortune must have come; it might be that the
god would again show favour to his people, turn aside
their misfortune and slavery, and raise up the kingdom
from the depths. In vain had Cr&#339;sus attempted by
lavish presents to win the favour of Sandon-Apollo;
there still remained the last great sacrifice. So he
resolved to offer himself as a peace-offering for his
land and people. In this way he might succeed in
laying the foundation of the future liberation and rise
of Lydia, in conquering by his death his successful
opponent. The sacrifice of the heir to the throne and
of the king himself in his purple to avert the anger of
the sun-god was not unknown in Semitic rites. Zimri
of Israel had burnt himself with his citadel in Tirzah;
Ahaz of Judah, when defeated by the Damascenes, had
sacrificed his son as a burnt-offering; Manasses of
Judah "caused his son to pass through the fire in the
valley of Ben Hinnom" (III. 43, 209); the last king
of Asshur had burnt himself with his palace in the year
607 <small>B.C.</small>; Hamilcar, the son of Hanno, threw himself
into the flames of the sacrificial fire in order to turn
the battle of Himera. Cyrus had no reason for pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>venting
the death of his opponent, if he chose to die.
Though he was offering himself as a sacrifice to his
gods, these gods were false in the eyes of the Persians&mdash;they
were evil spirits or demons. The Persian king
could quite understand the resolution of Cr&#339;sus not to
outlive the fall of a prosperous and mighty kingdom,
and to escape a long imprisonment, and would probably
look on it as worthy of a brave man. Still less
could he object to the wish of a king to die in his
royal robes. That the cremation was a sacrifice and
not an execution is further proved by the circumstance
that Cr&#339;sus is accompanied by twice seven youths.
It could never have entered the mind of Cyrus to
seize and execute fourteen youths, but they might
be quite ready to sacrifice themselves with their king.
The seventh planet belonged to Adar-Sandon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
to the angry sun-god, and Cr&#339;sus had sat on the
throne fourteen years.  The gifts also which the
Lydian women bring or send to the pyre (costly robes
and ornaments of every kind, as was customary in
the great sacrifices of Sandon), are a distinct proof of
a peace-offering. In the picture at Pompeii Cr&#339;sus
has laurel branches round his head, and a wand
of laurel in his right hand, and this marks him out,
though in the Greek manner, as dedicated to Sandon;
a vase in the Louvre presents him seated on the pyre,
in a royal robe, with a crown of laurel on his head.
In his left hand he holds a sceptre, with the right he
is pouring libations from a goblet, while a servant
is sprinkling with water the already burning pyre.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
But the sun-god would not accept the royal sacrifice
and peace-offering. It was no favourable sign that
the weather was gloomy (&#967;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#974;&#957;)
on that day, as
Nicolaus, who here, no doubt, follows Xanthus the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Lydian, tells us, though no rain had fallen. The pyre
was kindled; Cr&#339;sus prayed that Sandon would
graciously accept the offering&mdash;the invocation of the
god by Cr&#339;sus with tears Herodotus gives on the
authority of the Lydians<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&mdash;but the prayer is not
heard; a storm of rain descends, and the pyre is
quenched. This was an unmistakable sign, the
clearly-pronounced decision of the god, that he did
not and would not accept the sacrifice. Cr&#339;sus
must abandon his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>At no time can Cyrus have had the intention of
doing any further injury to the captive king of the
Lvdians. Herodotus told us that before the battle at
Sardis he bade his soldiers spare Cr&#339;sus. And he
would be the more inclined to show favour and grace
to a man whose death heaven had openly prevented.
As Ctesias told us (p. 16), he allotted to Cr&#339;sus the
city of Barene, near Ecbatana, as a residence or means
of support. Ptolemy mentions the city of Uarna in
the neighbourhood of Ragha, and the Avesta speaks of
Varena in the same region.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> After that day Cr&#339;sus
submitted to his fate; we find him at the court of
Cyrus as well as at that of Cambyses in an honourable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
position; both Cyrus and his successor at times apply
to him for advice.</p>

<p>The convulsion which Cyrus had caused in the
Median empire might have ended with placing the
Persians at the summit instead of the Medes, and
establishing the power of Cyrus within the old borders
of the Median kingdom. Had Lydia and Babylonia
resolved to recognise this change; had they reasons
for the assumption that Cyrus would not go beyond
these limits, the old relation of the three powers
might have been renewed, though it would not have
been confirmed by the bonds of alliance. But Lydia
no less than Babylonia believed that they were
threatened by the advance of Cyrus. At the time
when Cr&#339;sus attacked him, Cyrus certainly did not
intend to proceed to the West beyond the borders of
Cappadocia. This is proved by the fact that he kept
within the Halys after the conquest of that country.
He must establish his power in the East before he
could extend his views to the distant West and Asia
Minor. It was Babylon which at that time was
threatened, if not actually attacked, by Cyrus. The
advance of the Persians to the West, which Cr&#339;sus
intended to prevent by his attack, was really caused
by it. He brought on the storm which he sought
to allay before it burst upon him. By attempting
to check the advance of Cyrus in the midst of Asia
he invited him to Sardis. The dominion of the
Mermnad&aelig; was at an end; Cr&#339;sus had lost it 140
years after his ancestor Gyges had won it. It is
seldom that a sovereign is hurled so suddenly as
Cr&#339;sus from the summit of power and prosperity;
that the splendour of a high and glorious position
stands in such close and striking proximity to the
deepest humiliation. There is hardly any instance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of a warlike and brave nation passing so suddenly
and utterly into obscurity as the Lydians; and never
has so ancient, so flourishing, and powerful a kingdom,
while yet in the period of its growth, been so swiftly
overthrown, never to rise again.</p>

year 556. The date of the year for the capture of Sardis is destroyed,
and cannot be even approximately restored, as the nearest dates are
either mutilated or destroyed. The dates in Eusebius are derived
from Apollodorus, who in turn draws from Eratosthenes. Eusebius
puts the testing of the oracles in Olymp. 57,3 = 550 <small>B.C.</small>, the march
of Cyrus against Cr&#339;sus in Ol. 57,4 = 549 <small>B.C.</small>, the capture of Cr&#339;sus
in Ol. 58,3 = 546 <small>B.C.</small> Jerome represents Cr&#339;sus as beginning the
war in Ol. 57,3 = 550 <small>B.C.</small> and puts his capture in Ol. 58,1 = 548 <small>B.C.</small>
According to the statement of Syncellus (1,455, ed. Bonn.), Cr&#339;sus
was defeated in the 14th year of Cyrus, which would give 547 <small>B.C.</small>, if
with Eusebius, who allows Cyrus to reign 31 years, we put his accession
in 560 <small>B.C.</small> (V. p. 381 <i>n.</i>). The interval of three years which Eusebius
(549-546) and two years which Jerome (550-548) places between
the beginning of the war and the capture of Cr&#339;sus, appears to
be due to the three years for which, according to Herodotus, Apollo
delayed the overthrow of Cr&#339;sus; the presents came to Delphi
three years before the fall (Herod. 1, 91). According to Herodotus
the campaign occupies only one summer and autumn. The temple
of Delphi was burned down in 548 <small>B.C.</small> (Ol. 58,1; Pausan. 10, 5,
13), and as Herodotus represents the temple as intact at the time
when Cr&#339;sus sent to Delphi after his fall, this must have taken
place before 548 <small>B.C.</small>, and therefore Cr&#339;sus must have been conquered
by Cyrus in 549 <small>B.C.</small> If the justification of the oracle in Herodotus is
merely an invention of the priests, yet in things so well known the
existing circumstances could not be left out of sight. It is certain that
if the presents of Cr&#339;sus had been injured by the burning of the
temple before his fall, this evil omen would not have been left
out of sight by the legend, or by Herodotus, who himself saw and
mentions the lion of Cr&#339;sus at Delphi which had been injured by the
fire (1, 50). I have therefore no scruple in putting the fall of the
Lydian kingdom in the year 549 <small>B.C.</small> Though the reign given by
Herodotus for Cr&#339;sus, fourteen years and fourteen days, may have
arisen out of the fourteen Lydian boys who wished to be sacrificed
with their king (p. 12), yet Eusebius, Jerome, and Syncellus put
the reign of Cr&#339;sus at 15 years. It may therefore be regarded as an
established fact that his reign ended in the fifteenth year. According
to Herodotus (1, 64, 65), it might seem as though he were of opinion
that Cr&#339;sus sought allies in Hellas at the time when Pisistratus was
tyrant for the third time over Athens. But this would be an error due
to Herodotus' habit of anticipation. We can only be concerned with
the second tyranny of Pisistratus, which belongs to the years 550 and
549 <small>B.C.</small> Against the argument here used&mdash;that the priests could not
leave out of sight the actual circumstances in things so widely known,
even in their inventions, B&uuml;dinger objects: "The chronological relations
in Lydian-Persian history were neither various nor generally
known, when Herodotus visited Delphi." The objection would be
pertinent if the legend of the priests had only been manufactured
during Herodotus' stay at Delphi, and for his use. This is not tenable.
The fall of Cr&#339;sus was an event which deeply moved the Hellenic
world, and created the most lively astonishment; the responses of
Delphi had allured him to war; the oracle must at once justify itself
if it were not to lose considerably in its authority. The justification
must, therefore, have been invented at once; in the cities of Anatolia
it would be best known at that time how and when the Mede came
into the land with the fall of Cr&#339;sus
(&#960;&#951;&#955;&#943;&#954;&#959;&#962;
&#7974;&#963;&#952;&rsquo;
&#8005;&#952;&rsquo; &#8001; &#924;&#8134;&#948;&#959;&#962;
&#7936;&#966;&#943;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#894;
Xenophanes in Athenaeus, p. 54), and it was also known everywhere
how long before the great presents of Cr&#339;sus had come to Miletus and
Delphi. This must be noticed by the Delphian priests. But, as I
have expressly said, I have not laid any great stress on this fact, but
on the burning of the temple in 548 <small>B.C.</small>, for that is the only certain
point which can be gained. It does not seem possible to me to make
Xenophon's account of the Lydian and Babylonian wars of Cyrus in the
Cyropaedia a reason for placing the overthrow of Cr&#339;sus in 541 <small>B.C.</small>
and putting back the beginning of the third tyranny of Pisistratus to
that date in order to suit this account. There are also reasons of fact
against such a date, which are given elsewhere.</p></div>

would be favourable to Cr&#339;sus, could not possibly convert the merit

tradition of the Greek cities&mdash;favourable to Cr&#339;sus and unfavourable
to Cyrus&mdash;which we have in the account of Herodotus. The rescue of
Cr&#339;sus and the wisdom of Solon were the points of view given in the
Greek tradition and guiding it. If Nicolaus of Damascus has used
Xanthus, and his account rests on a combination of the Greek and
Lydian tradition&mdash;it is precisely in his account that the sacrifice, and
the prevention of it by rain, comes out more clearly than in Herodotus.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE SUBJUGATION OF ASIA MINOR.</h3>


<p>However unexpected the attack of the Lydians had
been by the ruler of the Medes and Persians, however
inconvenient the war with them, he had brought it to
a rapid and prosperous decision. Though he had entertained
no thought of conquests in the distant West
before Cr&#339;sus took up arms against him, he resolved
to maintain the advantage which the war had brought
him to such a surprising extent. Great as was the
distance between Sardis and Pasargadae, Lydia was
to be embodied in his empire, and the &AElig;gean was to
form its western boundary. His army took up winter
quarters in Lydia; from Sardis he arranged in person
the new government of the land, and the fate of the
nations which had been subject to the Lydians. We
do not know whether the Phrygians, Bithynians, and
Paphlagonians submitted to the change of dominion
without resistance. &AElig;schylus represents Cyrus as
subjugating Phrygia. According to Xenophon, Phrygia
was reduced by Cyrus as he returned from Sardis;
the Paphlagonians submitted voluntarily, like the
Cilicians; this was the reason why no satraps were sent
there, yet the fortresses were occupied with Persian
garrisons, and the Paphlagonians and Cilicians had to
pay tribute and perform service in war.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Cilicia had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
not been subject to the Lydians; ever since the
irruption of the Scyths had broken the cohesion of the
Assyrian power, her princes were independent, though
they had paid tribute to Assurbanipal (III. 166, 178),
They bore the standing title of Syennesis. More than
sixty years previously Nabopolassar of Babylon and
Syennesis of Cilicia had brought about peace and
alliance between Cyaxares of Media and Alyattes of
Lydia (V. 295). That Cilicia now voluntarily submitted
to Cyrus, if it had not done so previously,
can be concluded with certainty from the fact that
we subsequently find kings named Syennesis at the
head of Cilicia, who are bound to pay tribute to the
Persian empire and render service in war.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Cyrus met more vigorous resistance in the west
of Asia Minor. The Lycians, who maintained their
independence against the Lydians in their mountains
to the south, were not inclined to submit to the
Persians, nor were their neighbours in the south-west,
the Carians. The cities of the Greeks, who possessed
the entire western coast, hesitated which course to
take. After their ancestors had set foot on this coast,
400 years previously, they had succeeded in maintaining
their ground for a century and a half against the
rising power of the Lydians under the Mermnads;
indeed it was during this period that they had
extended their trade and colonisation, and risen to
be a second naval power beside the Phenicians,&mdash;the
centre of a commerce, which on the one hand included
the Black Sea and the Maeotis, and on the other
almost all the Mediterranean&mdash;which included in its
empire Cyprus and Sicily and Corsica, Egypt and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the mouths of the Po and Rhone, and even extended
to the banks of the B&aelig;tis. Along with the trade
and wealth of these cities, poetry had burst into
a new bloom, plastic art and architecture were
eagerly cultivated, the foundations were laid for
Greek science, natural history, geography, history,
and philosophy. Life was pleasant and luxurious;
no doubt the morals of the Lydians had found their
way into the cities, but the old vigour still remained
in the inhabitants by sea and land. At last they had
succumbed to Cr&#339;sus, not because they did not know
how to fight, but because they had not followed the
advice of Thales of Miletus, who urged them to carry
on the war in common, and place at their head a
council with dictatorial powers (III. 450). But the
supremacy of Cr&#339;sus, to which they did not submit
for much more than a decade, had not been of an
oppressive character. It had left the cities unchanged
in their internal trade, and in fact had increased
rather than destroyed it. Cr&#339;sus had contented
himself with yearly tributes from the cities, and
we have seen to what a large extent Greek art and
manners found protection, favour, and advancement
at the court of Cr&#339;sus. Now these cities suddenly
found themselves in the presence of a power of
which they had hardly heard the name, and which
had prostrated with a mighty blow the kingdom
of Cr&#339;sus. As they were not pledged to provide
soldiers for the king of the Lydians, they had looked
on in irresolute neutrality during the war. And they
had paid no heed to the request of Cyrus that they
would join his side. Previously it might have been
to their interest to weaken the power of Lydia, in
order to regain their full independence, but when
Cyrus marched upon Sardis it became much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
imperative to prevent a stronger power from taking
the place of the Lydians. A diversion on the part of
the Greek cities when Cyrus was besieging Sardis,
would have delayed the fate of the city, and might
have rendered possible the arrival of the allies. But
they had done nothing, and now found themselves
alone in the presence of the conqueror. Their danger
prompted them to offer submission to the king of the
Persians on the same terms as those on which they
had served Cr&#339;sus. Cyrus rejected the offer which
the ambassadors of the Ionian and Aeolian cities
brought to Sardis. Mere recognition of his supremacy
and payment of tribute he did not consider sufficient
to secure the obedience of cities so remote, and he
was strong enough to insist on a more dependent
relation without great efforts.  But ever cautious
and provident, he took means to separate the cities.
To Miletus, the strongest, he offered a continuance
of the relations in which she had stood to Lydia.
When Miletus, "from fear," as Herodotus remarks,
accepted these conditions, Cyrus had already won
the victory. The cities were divided, robbed of their
strongest power and natural head.</p>

<p>Conscious that their submission on the conditions
proposed had been refused, the cities of the Ionian
tribe took counsel at their old common place of
sacrifice on the shore of the sea, opposite Samos,
under Mount Mycale. Miletus, it is true, was absent;
but among the Ionians there was far too much
pride, far too great a sense of freedom, to offer
unconditional submission to Cyrus. The defection
of Miletus seemed to be compensated when ambassadors
of the cities of the Aeolian tribe appeared
on the same day as the Ionians, which had never
occurred before, and declared their common resolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
"to follow the Ionians wherever they led."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It was
resolved to fortify the cities, to make a resistance to
the Persians, and for this object to call as quickly as
possible on the mother country for help. A common
embassy of the Ionian and Aeolian cities went to Sparta,
in order to ask aid of the Dorians there, the leading
state in the peninsula. But in vain did Pythermus
of Phocaea, the mouthpiece of the embassy, put on
his purple robe in order to manifest the importance
and wealth of the cities, when the ephors introduced
the legation before the common assembly. Though
the Spartans at that time were at the height of their
power, and had promised help to Cr&#339;sus, though
the ships had been equipped and the contingent was
ready to embark when the news came of the capture
of Sardis, Sparta now refused to send aid, regardless
of the fate of her countrymen. She merely resolved
to despatch ambassadors to Cyrus with the request
that he would leave the Greek cities in peace. A
ship of fifty oars carried the embassy to Asia, with
the real object, as Herodotus supposes, of ascertaining
the position of affairs in Ionia and with Cyrus. It
landed at Phocaea. Lacrines, the spokesman of the
ambassadors, found Cyrus in Sardis, and there warned
him in Sparta's name, "to do no harm to any Hellenic
city, for Sparta would not allow such conduct to go
unpunished." Without the support of an army this
warning was an empty and foolish threat, which
Cyrus treated as it deserved.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>There must have been some urgent necessity which
summoned Cyrus to the East before he subjected the
Lydians, Carians, and Greeks of the coast. Herodotus
tells us that he intended to conquer Babylon, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Bactrian nation, the Sac&aelig; and Egyptians. In the
early spring he set out with the bulk of his army to
Ecbatana.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Cr&#339;sus was in his train. He had given
the government of Lydia to Tabalus, a Persian, but
the management of the revenues to Pactyas, a
Lydian.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> He may have thought that Lydia was
more peaceable than it really was, or more reconciled
to its fate by his gentle treatment of Cr&#339;sus, and
the nomination of a Lydian as manager of the taxes.
The dominion of the Persians had come upon the
Lydians suddenly; they refused to recognise the
superior power of their rulers, and could not finally
accept the rapid change which had so suddenly
overthrown their ancient kingdom and their fame
in arms. So far from being subdued, they hardly
considered themselves seriously beaten. The rapid
and decisive action, in which they had been defeated,
might appear to them rather a fortunate surprise, than
a victory won by the Persians. It was Pactyas, whom
Cyrus had made manager of the revenues, who raised
the standard of revolt. He collected the Lydians,
and induced the inhabitants of the coast, i.&nbsp;e. the
cities of the Greeks, to join him. Tabalus could not
resist in the open field the sudden outburst of
rebellion. When Pactyas marched against Sardis,
he was compelled to shut himself up in the citadel,
and was there besieged. While yet on his march
Cyrus received the news of the revolt. Yet his
presence in upper Asia was so necessary that he did
not return in person; he sent Mazares, a Mede, with
a part of the army, to bring the Lydians once more
to obedience. The rebellion appears to have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
undertaken in haste without sufficient preparations,
and Pactyas was not the man to lead it with energy.
He did not venture to await the arrival of Mazares;
the citadel of Sardis was delivered; Tabalus was free;
the rebellion was crushed; Pactyas fled to the Greeks
on the coast, to Cyme, the leading city of the
Aeolians. When Mazares demanded that he should
be given up, the oracle of Apollo at Miletus twice
ordered the Cym&aelig;ans, in answer to their repeated
inquiry, to surrender him. The priests of that temple,
the Branchid&aelig;, well knew that the arrangement which
their city had made with Cyrus, pledged her to carry
out the wishes of the Persians. The Cym&aelig;ans did not
obey even the second response, but first took Pactyas
in safety to Mytilene in Lesbos, and when they found
that the Mytileneans were ready to give him up,
they took him to Chios. But the Chians, though,
like the Lesbians, they had nothing to fear from the
Persians in their island, nevertheless surrendered him.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The hopes which the Greek cities might have built
upon the rebellion of the Lydians were quickly
broken. The mother country had refused any help.
Sparta would not come to their assistance, and
Athens, torn as she was by internal dissensions, could
not. No one in the cantons of the Greek peninsula
roused themselves to give aid to an important section
of the Greek nation, to the colonies which had outstripped
the mother country in their development, or
strove to save the most vigorous centres of Greek
nationality from subjection to a foreign people, which
had come out of the remote part of Asia. If the voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of a common blood and the sense of nationality failed
to warn the Greeks beyond the sea against giving over
to strangers for plunder such rich and flourishing cities,
was there no one in Hellas who foresaw that if the
establishment of the Persian dominion on the coasts of
Asia Minor were not prevented, and the cities of the
coast with their navy were allowed to fall into the
hands of the Persians, Greece itself would not be safe
from their attack, and they would be able to visit the
coasts of Hellas in Greek ships? Yet even without
assistance the power of the Hellenic cities would have
sufficed for a considerable resistance to the Persians&mdash;for
the position of affairs in Asia did not allow Cyrus
to bring any great force against these distant coasts&mdash;if
they had been able to understand and take to heart
the lessons of their own past. If they had neglected
to unite their forces against the Lydians, such union
was now doubly necessary. They had learned from
experience the evil of delay, and the danger was
now greater than ever. The Greek cities were in
uncontested possession of the sea,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and thus in a
position to give help in common to any city which
the Persians might attack. An organisation which
permitted the whole force of the city to be used for
the benefit of each one, would have given a prospect
of successful resistance. But no step whatever was
taken in this direction. Each city turned its attention
to strengthening its own walls, and awaiting the
attack of the Persians.</p>

<p>After the subjugation of the Lydians, Mazares, as
Herodotus tells us, turned his arms against "those
who had besieged Tabalus along with Pactyas." He
invested Priene, took the city, and reduced the inhabitants
to slavery; then the plain of the Maeander<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was laid waste, the city of Magnesia taken, and its
inhabitants enslaved. After the capture of Magnesia
Mazares fell sick and died. Cyrus sent Harpagus the
Mede as his successor. He marched northwards from
the valley of the Maeander; in the first instance
against Phocaea, which appeared to have taken the
leading part in resistance, or at any rate had done
most to gain the help of Sparta; after Miletus it
was the most powerful city of the Ionians. The
trade in the Adriatic and the Tyrrhene sea, on the
coasts of Gallia and Iberia, was in the hands of
the Phocaeans. A strong and magnificent wall, well
built of large stones, surrounded the city, the circuit
of which, as Herodotus says, reached "not a few
stadia." Harpagus invested Phocaea, and threw up
works round the walls; he then sent intelligence
to the Phocaeans that he should be content if they
would pull down but one tower, and solemnly give up
to him the possession of one dwelling. The Phocaeans
must have thought that they could no longer hold
the city or repulse an attack. According to Herodotus,
they answered the offer of Harpagus with
a request that he would allow them a day for consideration,
and for that day would lead his army
from the wall. Harpagus replied that he knew very
well what their intentions were, but he would give
them time for consideration. When Harpagus led his
forces from the wall, the Phocaeans drew their ships
to the sea, put upon them their wives and children,
and everything that they could carry away, even the
images of the gods and the votive offerings, and then
embarked and sailed to Chios. It was their intention
to purchase from the Chians the Oenuss&aelig;, islands lying
off Chios, and to settle there. But the Chians refused
to sell them, fearing that their trade would go there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Then the Phocaeans turned their course back to
Phocaea; Harpagus had taken possession of the
empty city and left a garrison in it. This the
Phocaeans cut down; then they sunk a large mass
of iron in the sea, with an oath that they would not
return again to the city till the iron should float, and
shaped their course to the distant Western sea, for
the island of Cyrnus (Corsica), where twenty years
previously they had founded the colony of Alalia.
Harpagus is said to have burnt Phocaea, thus punishing
the houses and temples for the attack on the
garrison.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> After the capture of this city, he besieged
Teos, and gained possession of the walls by means of
the works which he threw up. The Teians then went
on board their ships, one and all, sailed to the north,
and settled on the coast of Thrace opposite Thasos,
where they founded Abdera.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "So all the Ionians,"
says Herodotus, "with the exception of the Milesians,
who had come to terms with Cyrus, fought against
Harpagus, and showed themselves brave warriors,
each for his own city; but Harpagus took them one
after the other by investing them and throwing up
works against the walls. Thus conquered they remained
in their cities, with the exception of those
exiles, and did what they were bid." After the subjugation
of the Ionians, Harpagus turned to the North,
reduced the cities of the Aeolians, and bade their
military forces join his army.</p>

<p>The line of conquest had now reached the Dorian
cities of the coast, the Carians and Lycians. The
Dorians and Carians made but little resistance.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Greeks of Asia had not only been abandoned by their
kinsmen beyond the sea, but also by their gods, or at
any rate by their oracles. As Apollo of Miletus had
bidden the Cymaeans to give up Pactyas, so Apollo
of Delphi bade the Cnidians to desist from making
their city impregnable. Cnidus lay on the western
edge of a long and narrow promontory. The inhabitants
had begun to cut a channel through the land
with a view of securing themselves against the attack
of the Persians. But though a large number of hands
were engaged, the work did not make progress in the
hard rock; and as many of the workmen were injured
the city sent to Delphi to inquire the cause of their
misfortunes. The priestess answered, according to
the Cnidian account: "Ye must not fortify the
Isthmus, nor cut through it; Zeus would have made
it an island if he had wished."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Cnidians desisted,
and surrendered without a struggle to Harpagus on
his approach. Among the Carians, the Pedasians
alone, who had fortified Mount Lida, made a vigorous
resistance; it cost Harpagus much trouble to take
this fortification. The Lycians, who had never been
subject to the kings of the Lydians, marched out
against Harpagus. In the open field they fought
bravely, though few against many. When conquered
and driven into their city Xanthus (Arna, I. 577),
they brought their wives and children, their servants,
and their goods into the citadel and set them
on fire; then they bound themselves by an oath,
fell upon the Persian army, and maintained the conflict
to the last man. Then the remaining towns of
the Lycians, being robbed of their best defenders, submitted.
The Caunians alone, as Herodotus tells us,
followed almost exactly the example of the city of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Xanthus.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Even the sea put no limit to the supremacy
of the Persians. The Greeks of the islands
of Chios and Lesbos voluntarily submitted to them,
though, as Herodotus assures us, "they had nothing
to fear," "for the Persians were not mariners, and the
Phenicians were not their subjects at that time."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
The two islands would not give up all hope of the
possession of the districts on the coasts opposite.</p>

<p>About three years after Cyrus had left Sardis
in the spring of the year 548 <small>B.C.</small> his power in
Lydia was not only firmly founded, but the whole
western coast, with all its harbours and landing-places,
together with two considerable islands, was
subject to him. As Aeschylus tells us, he had reduced
Ionia by force. The East had again overpowered
the colonists of the West on its western edge.
Asia Minor, beyond the Halys, was subjugated to
Cyrus in even greater extent than to Cr&#339;sus; in fact
it was wholly in his power.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> He placed two viceroys
over it. One, the viceroy of Phrygia, was to
govern the north-eastern; the other, the viceroy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Lydia, was to govern the south-western half of this
wide region. The first took up his position at
Dascyleum, not far from the shore of the Propontis;
the other in the citadel at Sardis.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Among the
cities of the Greeks, Priene and Magnesia on the
Maeander had been destroyed, and their inhabitants
enslaved; Phocaea had been burned. The rest had
not been injured by Harpagus after their capture;
he had not placed any Persian governors over them,
nor introduced garrisons. It was not intended in
any way to destroy their nationality or their religious
worship. Their social life, their forms of government,
their autonomy remained; even the common sacrifices
and assemblies of the Ionian cities at Mycale were
permitted to continue. They had only to recognise
the supreme authority of the king of the Persians
and his viceroys, to pay yearly tribute to the king,
the amount of which each city fixed for itself,
and furnish a contingent to the army when called
upon by the viceroy to do so. When the Ionians
again met at the common place of sacrifice for the
first time after their subjugation, Bias of Priene, who
had escaped the destruction of his country, proposed
that all the Ionian cities should follow the example
of the Phocaeans and Teians; that there should be
a general emigration to Sardinia, in order that all
might obtain a new country there. They were then
to form one great community; one city was to be
founded by all in common. Had this proposal been
carried out, the achievements of Cyrus would have
exercised a far deeper influence over the distant West,
than the mere settlement of the Phocaeans in Alalia,
who moreover were not able to maintain themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in their new settlement. The centre of Hellenic
colonisation would have been transplanted from East
to West, and the fate of Italy would have been
changed; the Greeks would have retired before the
supremacy of the East in order to establish a strong
insular power among the weak communities of the
West. But the Ionians could not rise to the height
of such a revolution. Among the Greeks, the attachment
to their ancient soil, their homes and temples,
was peculiarly strong. If men could and would forget
independence, the supremacy of the Persians did not
seem very oppressive. It limited the trade of the
Greeks as little as it repressed their social life; on
the contrary, it rather advanced commerce, which
now received the protection of the Persian king
throughout the whole of his wide dominions. The
ruin of Phocaea also aided the trade of Miletus
which had suffered neither war nor siege.</p>

<p>Yet the cities of the Greeks were essentially
weakened by the war and their subjugation. In
Phocaea, it is true, a community again grew up. Half
of the emigrants, in spite of their solemn vow, were
seized with a longing for their ancient home; they
returned to their desolated city. But for fifty years
after this time the new Phocaea would or could furnish
no more than three ships of war. In Priene also and
Teos sufficient inhabitants gradually assembled to
establish small communities.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Other circumstances
weighed more heavily even than their natural losses.
Cyrus knew well that it would not be easy to retain
in secure obedience cities so distant in situation, so
important in population and military resources. At
such a distance isolated garrisons would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
exposed to great danger; yet without them the cities
would have closed their gates to the Persians at any
moment, manned their walls, and entered into combinations
beyond the sea. Every rebellion of this
kind made new sieges necessary, and these were the
more difficult as Persia had no fleet, and could only
use the ships of the Greeks. Situated at the extreme
edge of the kingdom, and supported by the opposite
shore of the &AElig;gean, each of the larger cities could
offer a long resistance. With the unerring political
insight which distinguished him, Cyrus saw that he
must gain adherents within the cities, and have on his
side influential interests of sufficient weight to keep
the cities in obedience. Yet he did not aim at supporting
one or other of the parties who contended in the
Greek cities for the leadership of the community; on
the other hand, his favour and that of his viceroys
was given to this or that party-leader. His allegiance
was to be secured and certain advantages were held
out in prospect to the city when led by him. Cyrus
intended to govern the cities of the Greeks by Greeks,
who were not to be his officers, but to rule the
cities as their lords and princes for their own advantage
and profit. By their position, which they owed
to the favour of Persia, and could only maintain with
the help of Persia against their fellow-citizens, by the
interested desire to retain this power in their families
and bequeath it to their children, by the concentration
of the princely authority, as opposed to the
republican institutions and republican spirit of their
cities&mdash;which authority rested on the Persian court,
and was closely connected with it&mdash;these rulers in
union with the viceroys and their troops must be in a
position to secure the subjection of the cities. Thus
it came to pass that not in Cyme only, the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
important city of the Aeolians, but in almost all the
towns of the Greeks, men were raised to power by
the favour and support of the Persian satraps, who
managed the public affairs, and in the place of
autonomous communities came despotisms and principalities,
in reality if not in name. How correct
Cyrus was is proved by the result.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He was able to
secure the obedience of the Lydians also. He caused
the land to be stripped of its arms, even to the extent
of taking away the cavalry horses,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and so abandoned
all thought of forcing the Lydians to serve in his
army. The disuse of arms and the lapse of time
did their work, aided as they were by a vigorous
trade, which in Lydia was due not only to the natural
wealth and the gold of the soil, but to a long-established
and skilful industry. In these pursuits and
a luxurious life the Lydians forgot their old days and
ancient deeds. Persia had never again to contend
with a rebellion of the Lydians.</p>

<p>The tradition of the Greeks has not omitted to
illustrate the important events of the extension and
establishment of the Persian dominion in Asia Minor
by a series of pointed anecdotes and stories. Among
these is the reply which Cyrus is said to have given
to the Greek cities, when they offered their submission
after the fall of Sardis (p. 50). At that time Cyrus,
as Herodotus tells us, narrated the following story
with reference to their refusal of his first request:&mdash;A
flute-player once played to some fishes in the sea in
order to entice them out. As they did not come, he
took them out with a net, and when they leapt about,
he said, Cease dancing now; ye did not dance out of
the water when I played. Diodorus puts the trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>action
later, and with him it is not Cyrus, but
Harpagus, who, as we saw, received the command
against the cities after Mazares, who told the following
apologue to the ambassadors:&mdash;He had once asked
a maid of her father in marriage, but the father
betrothed her to a man of greater importance. When
he afterwards found out that the man whom he had
despised as a son-in-law was in favour with the king
he brought him his daughter, and Harpagus took her
not for his wife, but for his concubine. By this
Harpagus meant that as the Greeks had not become
friends of the Persians when Cyrus wished it, they
could not any longer be allies but only servants.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
When Lacrines brought to Cyrus from the Spartans
the command that he must not attack any Greek
city, Herodotus represents Cyrus as answering, in
the pride of his absolute power, that he had never
been afraid of men who met in the market-places and
deceived each other by speeches and promises. If he
remained in health, they would not have to lament
over the sorrows of the Ionians, but over their own.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Here also Diodorus gives another version:&mdash;To the
command of the Spartans that he must not attack the
Hellenes in Asia who were their kinsmen, Cyrus
answered, that he would acquaint himself with the
bravery of the Spartans when he sent one of his
servants to subjugate Hellas.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The account which Herodotus gives of the negotiations
of Harpagus with the Phocaeans is not historical.
If the resistance of the Phocaeans was so
difficult to overcome that Harpagus descended to
the concession that only one tower need be pulled
down and a single habitation given up to him, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Phocaeans had no reason to abandon their city. But if
they were in such a condition that they must abandon
the defence, the lapse of one day would certainly
not suffice for them to get the ships in order, and
put on board the whole population with their goods,
the images of their gods, and the votive offerings.
Still more inconceivable would be the folly of Harpagus
in drawing off his army from the city and thus
allowing the Phocaeans to destroy his siege works, so
that he had to begin them all anew.</p>

<p>The striking change which took place in the Lydian
character after the suppression of the rebellion under
Pactyas, the contrast between the horse-breeding
Lydians of the Homeric poems, between the mounted
squadrons which once pressed so heavily on the
Greek cities, reduced Asia Minor, and offered such a
brave resistance to the Medes and Persians, and the
peace-loving, effeminate, submissive Lydians of the
fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, was explained by the Greek tradition
after its own manner. When in his return from
Sardis to Ecbatana, Cyrus received the intelligence of
the rebellion of the Lydians, he confided to Cr&#339;sus,
as Herodotus tells us, that it seemed to him the best
plan to make all the Lydians slaves. "I have dealt
with them," so Herodotus represents Cyrus as saying,
"as one who spares the children when he has slain the
father. I have captured you who have been more to
them than a father, and left them their city, and now
I wonder that they rebel." Cr&#339;sus replied: "What
you say is just, but let your anger pass by; do not
destroy an ancient and guiltless city. What took
place before was my doing, and the guilt lies on my
shoulders; what has happened now is due to Pactyas
to whom you yourself entrusted Sardis. Punish
him, but spare the Lydians. Forbid them to carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
weapons for the future, order them to wear coats
under their mantles, shoes with high heels, and to
train their boys in playing and singing and in trade.
You will soon make them women instead of men,
and they will never revolt or be a source of alarm."
Cr&#339;sus gave this advice with the double object of
turning aside the vengeance of Cyrus from the Lydians&mdash;for
even such a life was better than slavery&mdash;and
of preserving the Lydians for the future from
bringing about their own destruction by new rebellions.
Cyrus followed the advice of Cr&#339;sus. This
story is repeated by Polyaenus. When the Lydians
had revolted, Cyrus bade Mazares take away their
weapons and horses, and allow them no longer any
practice in throwing the spear and riding; on the
contrary, he was to compel them to wear women's
clothes, to weave, and play the lute. In this way the
Lydians became the most unwarlike people, though
previously they had been the most warlike.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The new
dress which Cyrus, on the advice of Cr&#339;sus, commanded
the Lydians to wear, was the hereditary dress
of the Lydians (who are called soft-footed in the
response of the Delphic priestess (p. 9), because they
wore shoes), and practice in playing and singing were
old customs of the Lydians which previously had done
no harm to their martial valour. The narrative is
invented, though not by Herodotus, to glorify the
wisdom of Cr&#339;sus and give a reason for the clemency
which Cyrus showed after the rebellion&mdash;and at the
same time to explain the contrast between the Lydians
of antiquity and their descendants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FALL OF BABYLON.</h3>


<p>When the kingdom of the Lydians had succumbed to
the arms of Cyrus, Babylonia alone was left of the
three states which had joined in the overthrow of
Assyria. It was a region of very considerable extent,
reaching from the Tigris to the coasts of Syria, and
from the foot of the Armenian and Cilician mountains
to the deserts of Arabia; the population was united,
and a strong centre was not wanting. As we saw,
Nebuchadnezzar had not only greatly increased the
agriculture and trade of his kingdom, but had also
erected the strongest barriers for the protection of
his native land and the metropolis. In this he had
only the Median power in view, but owing to the
victory of Cyrus over Astyages a stronger power had
taken the place of Media, and neither his wisdom nor
his energy had descended to his successors. After a
reign of two years his son Evilmerodach fell by the
hand of his own brother-in-law, Neriglissar, who sat
but four years on the throne which he had thus
acquired. The boy whom Neriglissar left behind was
murdered by the conspirators who in the year 555
<small>B.C.</small> elevated Nabonetus to the throne. Of this king
we only know that he did not belong to the race of
Nabopolassar. Neriglissar had continued the fortifi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>cation
of the metropolis, and Nabonetus completed
the walls which were intended to enclose the two
parts of the city of Babylon on the east and west of
the Euphrates towards the river. He continued the
buildings of Nebuchadnezzar at the temples at Ur
(Mugheir), and restored the ancient temple of Bilit
(Mylitta) at that place. His inscriptions entreat the
god Sin that his works may continue as the heavens,
and commend his first-born son Belshazzar (Bil-sarussur)
to the favour of the moon-god. To the city
of Tyre he gave a new king, Hiram of the race of
Ethbaal, in the year 551 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>We cannot ascertain what position Nabonetus took
up towards the growing power of Cyrus. According
to the statement of Trogus Pompeius, Babylon was at
war with Cyrus, when Cr&#339;sus went to her aid. Cyrus
repelled this attack, came to terms with Babylonia,
and carried on war against Asia Minor. Xenophon
represents Cr&#339;sus as beginning the war against Cyrus
at the request of the king of Babylon (p. 17).
Herodotus, as has been mentioned above, repeatedly
assures us that Cr&#339;sus was in league with the king of
Babylon, whom he calls Labynetus (p. 20). As we
saw, Cyrus left Sardis and Asia Minor in the spring
of 548 <small>B.C.</small>, before the nations of the western coast,
the Carians and Lycians, had been subjugated; and
Herodotus remarks that he intended to march against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Babylon. For Babylonia there could certainly be no
more favourable moment for carrying on the war with
the Persians than the time at which Cyrus lay opposite
the army of Cr&#339;sus at Pteria in Cappadocia,
before he advanced upon Sardis. A march of the
Babylonian army up the river Euphrates would have
cut off the communications of the Persian army with
their own home, and compelled Cyrus to abandon the
Lydians and to turn upon Babylon. We do not know
whether Nabonetus looked idly on at the fall of Cr&#339;sus
in spite of the league, or whether a second Persian
army compelled him to leave events to take their
course in Asia Minor, or whether Cyrus, on his return
to Ecbatana, after the overthrow of Cr&#339;sus, as Herodotus
tells us, marched against Nabonetus. All that
we know from Herodotus is that Harpagus subdued
lower Asia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Asia Minor, and Cyrus himself upper
Asia, passing from one nation to another without any
exception.</p>

<p>"The greater part of their achievements," Herodotus
continues, "I will omit; I will only narrate that feat
which cost the most trouble and is the most worthy
of notice. When Cyrus had reduced the whole of the
continent he attacked the Assyrians. Now Assyria
had many other large cities, but the most famous and
strongest of them was Babylon, where their kings
dwelt after the destruction of Nineveh. Labynetus
was ruler of the Assyrians, and against him Cyrus
marched." According to this more exact statement,
Cyrus did not march against Babylon directly after
the Lydian war, but only "when the whole of upper
Asia had been reduced to subjection." That Elam
and the land between the lower Tigris and the
mountains of Persia was subject to Cyrus before he
attacked Babylonia, follows from the statements of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a prophet of the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Berosus says quite distinctly:
"When Cyrus had subjugated the whole
of Asia, he set out with a great power from Persia
against Babylon in the seventeenth year of the reign
of Nabonetus."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> We can establish the correctness
of this date from other sources, and prove that the
war between Babylon and Persia, which Herodotus
sets himself to describe in the words quoted, took
place ten years after the Lydian war. Yet it remains
doubtful whether Babylonia and Persia had already
met in arms, before, during, or immediately after the
Lydian war. So much only is certain, that if a collision
of this kind had previously taken place, it was indecisive.
Nor can we make it clear what motives
caused Nabonetus to allow Cyrus to attack Babylonia
at a time most convenient to himself; whether this
attitude was due to the experience of previous
failures, or to a feeling of confidence that the natural
and artificial barriers of the Babylonian land offered a
better prospect of success under any circumstances,
than an attack on Persia.</p>

<p>We have already seen how faithfully the Jews,
whom Nebuchadnezzar had transported to Mesopotamia
and Babylonia in the year 597 <small>B.C.</small>, and
again in 586 <small>B.C.</small> when he conquered and destroyed
Jerusalem, clung to their God and their religion
(III. 395). They cherished the firm hope that the
judgment which had fallen on Judah and Jerusalem
would come to an end, and Jehovah's anger would
turn, when the purification was completed; that the
kingdom of David would be restored, and Babylon
punished for all that it had done to Jerusalem.
Since the times of Hosea and Isaiah, the prophets
of the Israelites had always pointed beyond the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
punishments which Jehovah would send upon the sins
of his people to their restoration in a happy future.
Thus in the first year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,
Jeremiah had announced that Jehovah would allow
the King of Babel to come upon Judah and Jerusalem,
but that the servitude of Judah would only
continue for a definite period&mdash;for seventy years
(III. 326); and Ezekiel had definitely and solemnly
announced the restoration of the national sanctuary
to his people in Mesopotamia (III. 395). Zealously
devoted to the worship of the God whose strong hand
alone could break their yoke asunder and lead back
their weak numbers to their home, the exiles impatiently
awaited the fall of Babylon. It was their firm
hope that as Assyria had fallen, which had annihilated
Israel and brought the severest blows upon Judah,
so would the line of destruction reach Babylon also,
and vengeance would not be delayed. "By the waters
of Babylon we sat down and wept when we remembered
thee, O Zion. We hung up our harps on the
willows that are in the land; our conquerors asked
us for a melody, and those that troubled us for songs
of joy. How can we sing Jehovah's song in a strange
land? O daughter of Babylon, thou that makest
desolate, blessings be upon him who taketh thy children
and throweth them against the rocks."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>  "Why
go I sorrowing under the oppression of the enemy?
It was not by their sword that they took the land,
nor did their arms win the victory, but thou, O
Jehovah, wert gracious to them. All this came upon
us, and yet we were not faithless, our steps strayed
not from thy path. Tears are my food day and night,
while they say to me, Where is thy God? I thought
how I went with the multitude into the house of God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
with songs and thanksgiving. Thou art my King,
Jehovah (III. 396); send help to Jacob; with thy
name we shall tread down our enemies. I put not my
trust in my bow, but thou givest us victory over the
oppressor. Send thy light and thy truth, that they
may bring me to thy holy hill, to the God of my joy,
that I may praise thee on the lute. Why sleepest
thou, O Lord? Awake. Cast us not away for ever.
Our soul is bowed down to the dust, our body
pressed to the ground. Save us for thy mercy's
sake. I will yet praise him, who is my Saviour
and my God."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Even in the last years of Nebuchadnezzar, as they
looked on the mighty works with which the destroyer
of Jerusalem surrounded his city, the hopes of the
Jews rose. From these enormous structures they
might conclude how insecure Babylon felt herself
against the Medes. Immediately after the death
of the great and dreaded prince the Jews began to
dream of an attack of the Medes on Babylonia.
"Israel was a stray sheep," such are the words of
a prophet of this period, "which was in terror of
lions. The king of Assyria ate it, and Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, gnawed the bones." "But
the God of Israel says, 'I will have vengeance on
the king of Babel, as I had vengeance on the king
of Assyria, and I will lead Israel back, that he may
pasture on Carmel and Bashan, and satisfy himself
on Mount Ephraim and Gilead.'"<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> "Bel shall be put
to shame, and I will take out of his mouth that which
he has swallowed, and Merodach shall be overthrown,
their images and idols."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> "Thou who dwellest on
the great waters, thine end is approaching. Though
Babylon exalted herself to heaven, and made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
height of her fortification so that no one could pass
over, the broad walls shall be cast down and the high
gates shall be consumed with fire."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> "Set up a standard
against the walls of Babylon, summon against
her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni (Armenia), and
Ashenas; arm against her all the governors of the
kings of the Medes, and all the lands of their dominion.
Summon against her all who draw the bow; stand
round Babylon, ye archers, and spare not the arrows."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Similar views gave rise to another prophecy which
deduces the imminent fall of Babylon from her pride.
"Babylon said in her heart, I will climb up to
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of
God, and dwell on the hill of assembly in the uttermost
north.  I will climb to the heights of the
clouds, and make myself equal to the Highest. But
against them Jehovah arouses the Medes, who regard
not silver and have no pleasure in gold.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Call aloud
to them, wave the hand, that they may enter into
the gates of the tyrants. Their bows will destroy
her young men, and she laments not for her children.
And thus Babylon, the delight of the kingdoms, shall
be as Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall be no more
inhabited for ever; the Arab shall not pitch his tent
there, nor the shepherd feed his flock. Beasts of the
field shall dwell there; owls shall inhabit the houses,
ostriches shall make their home there, and the satyrs
shall dance. Jackals shall howl in her palaces, and
foxes in her pleasure-houses. I will make Babylon
a dwelling for the hedge-hog, saith Jehovah, and I
will sweep it with the besom of destruction. The
time is at hand, it will come quickly. Thy glory
is gone down into hell, and the noise of thy harps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Thy bed is with the worm, and thy covering is
corruption. How art thou fallen from heaven, O
Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou beaten
to the ground that didst lay low the nations!"<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The eager and impatient expectation of the Jews
could not but perceive the change which had been
made in the relation of the states of Asia by the
victory of Cyrus over Astyages and the Medes three
years after the death of Nebuchadnezzar. When
Cyrus afterwards subjugated the nations to the east
and west of Media, and the mighty kingdom of Lydia
was shattered by him, so that the fame of his victories
filled the East&mdash;when it might be expected that his
arms would turn against Babylon, the Jews considered
their rescue certain. With redoubled zeal they called
down the punishment of Jehovah on Babylon, and
delighted themselves in advance with the coming
vengeance. Cyrus was the instrument which Jehovah
had chosen to punish Babylon. As the old prophets
had seen in the kings of Assyria, and Jeremiah in
Nebuchadnezzar, the servants of Jehovah, who were
to carry out his will on the nations, and hold the
judgment day of the Lord, so did the Jews now
see in Cyrus a man called to a similar mission,
their saviour and liberator; he seemed to them the
anointed of Jehovah. If the absence of images in the
rites of the Persians, the worship of Auramazda, the
creator of heaven and earth, were nearer the religion
of the Jews than the sacrifices which the Babylonians
offered before the images of Bel and Bilit-Istar, Adar,
Samas and Sin, Merodach and Nebo, and the worship
which they devoted to the ruling powers of the stars,
they did not overlook the gulf which divided them; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
they were convinced that Jehovah chose Cyrus as the
rod of his anger, and the goad of his wrath, to punish
the pride and wickedness of Babylon. In this spirit
we find a prophet saying, with a definite reference to
the announcements of Jeremiah: "Who called him
from the East, whom victory meets at every step?
Who gives him the nations and subjugates kings to
him, and makes their swords as dust, and their bows
as chaff? He pursues them and follows safely in the
path which his feet have never trodden. I, Jehovah,
aroused him from the North (midnight), and he came
from the rising sun, who calls upon my name. He
passes over the mighty ones as over clay, as a potter
breaks a vessel. I summoned him for salvation, and
his ways will I make smooth; he shall build my city
and release my captives, without ransom and without
price. I will speak to Koresh (Cyrus), my shepherd;
all my business he shall perform, so that he will say
of Jerusalem, It shall be built, and of the temple,
It shall be established. And I will speak to Koresh,
mine anointed, whom I hold by his right hand to
throw down the nations before him, and strip the
loins of the kings, and open the gates and doors: I
called thee, though thou knewest me not;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> I will go
before thee and make plain the ramparts; I will
break in pieces the brazen gates, and the cross bars
will I loosen" (the gates of Babylon were of brass);<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
"I will say to the deep, Dry up, and thy streams I
will cause to be parched. Hear this, O wanton one,
O daughter of the Chald&aelig;ans, thou that didst lay thy
yoke heavily on my people, on the aged one, saying,
I  will be a lady for ever; but suddenly on one day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
thou shalt be childless and widowed. Keep to thy
incantations, to the multitude of the charms wherewith
thou hast comforted thyself from thy youth up.
May the quarters of the sky arise and help thee,
which look to the stars, which on the new moons
announce what will come upon thee. Bel boweth
down, Nebo falleth. No more shalt thou be called
mistress of the kingdoms, daughter of the Chald&aelig;ans.
I will place thee on the earth without a throne, I will
plant thee in the dust, and make thee crawl in the
darkness, O virgin, daughter of Babylon. Take the
mill and grind meal, remove thy veil, lift up thy
garment, lay bare the thigh, and pass through the
rivers; no more shalt thou be called delicate and
tender<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Zion said, Jehovah has left me, and my
Lord has forgotten me. Can a woman forget her
sucking child, and have no pity on the fruit of her

<p>Herodotus describes the approach of Cyrus and
his war against Babylon in the following manner:
"When on his march against Babylon he came to the
Gyndes (now the Diala), which falls into the Tigris,
and crossed it, one of the sacred white horses was
carried away by the stream. Cyrus was angry, and
threatened that he would make the river so insignificant
that a woman should cross it without wetting
her knee. With this view he drew 180 lines on
each side of the river, and bade his army dig a
channel on every line; and as a great multitude was
employed, the work was finished, but it occupied
the whole summer, so that Cyrus did not lead his
army against Babylon till the second spring. The
Babylonians marched out of the city and awaited
his attack. When Cyrus came up the Babylonians
joined battle; they were defeated, and driven into
the walls. They had known for a long time that
Cyrus would not remain at rest, for they had seen
how he had reduced all nations alike, and therefore
they had collected provisions for many years in the
city. The siege, therefore, caused them no alarm;
but Cyrus was in difficulties, for time passed away,
and he made no advance. Afterwards he did as
follows, whether it was that some one suggested the
plan to him, or whether he discovered it for himself.
He placed part of his army where the river flows into
the city, and part where it flows out, and bade them
enter the city by the river as soon as it could be
forded. After he had given them orders, he went
with the bulk of his army to the basin, which the
queen of the Babylonians had caused to be excavated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and did what she had done with the basin and the
river.  By leading the river through the opening
into this basin, which was a marsh, he made the old
bed so that it could be forded. When this had been
done, and the water of the river had fallen to such
an extent that it reached the middle of a man's thigh,
the Persians who had been placed near the city
forced their way into Babylon along the bed of the
river. Had the Babylonians previously known or
suspected what Cyrus intended, the Persians would
not have passed unnoticed into the walls; had they
closed the gates leading from the city to the river,
and mounted the walls which line the banks, they
would have caught the Persians in a trap as it were,
and they would have perished miserably. But the
Persians came quite unexpectedly. The outer parts
of the city had been already taken while those in
the centre, who, as the Babylonians say, knew nothing
of the matter, owing to the extent of the city, were
dancing and making merry&mdash;for it so happened that
a festival was being celebrated&mdash;until they at length
discovered their misfortune."</p>

<p>Xenophon relates that the inhabitants of Babylon
laughed at the siege, because the strong and lofty
walls could not be taken by storm, and the siege
would not hurt them, for they had provisions for
more than twenty years. Cyrus also soon convinced
himself that the city could not be taken by the
means which he was employing, and resolved to draw
off the Euphrates, which traverses the city in a stream
two stadia (1200 feet) in breadth, and twice the
height of a man in depth. For this object he threw
a rampart round the whole city, with a very broad
and deep trench before it on the side towards the
city. This great work was apportioned to the different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
parts of the army, and the time occupied in it was
calculated at a year. Where the trenches approached
the river the earth was not excavated, so that the
water would not flow into the trenches. When Cyrus
perceived that the Babylonians celebrated a festival
at a fixed time, at which they feasted for the whole
night, he caused the earth which separated the river
from the trenches above the city to be cut through
by a multitude of men as soon as it was dark; the
water at once ran into the trenches, and the river
sank so low that it could be forded. The river now
opened a way into the city, and Cyrus bade his
troops enter by its bed. They would find the inhabitants
drunk and asleep, without any organization for
resistance, and when they found the enemy in the
city they would lose all their courage. If the Babylonians,
nevertheless, attempted to hurl down missiles
from the roofs, the houses could be burned, and they
would take fire readily, as the doors were of palm-wood
covered with bitumen. A separate troop of
the Persian army, which Gobryas led, had orders
to make their way to the palace of the king as
quickly as possible. The Persians entered, and cut
down the inhabitants whom they found; others saved
themselves by flight. The watch of the palace were
drinking by a bright fire before the gates, which
were closed. They were surprised and cut down.
When the noise of the fight was heard inside the
palace, the king sent to inquire what was the meaning
of the tumult. But as soon as the gate was opened
the Persians forced their way into the palace; the
king and those around him drew their swords, but
succumbed to numbers, and were killed. Meanwhile
Cyrus had despatched his cavalry along the streets,
sending with them men skilled in the Syrian lan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>guage,
who proclaimed that every one who remained
in his house would be uninjured; all who showed
themselves in the streets would be put to death.
Thus the city quickly passed into the hands of the
Persians. The gates of the citadel were opened
the next morning, when the dawn of light showed
them the Persians in possession of the city.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Polyaenus gives two versions of the taking of
Babylon. The Babylonians laughed at the siege, as
they had provisions for many years. But Cyrus drew
off the Euphrates, which flows through the middle of
the city, and turned it into a neighbouring swamp.
As the Babylonians were thus cut off from drinking-water,
they soon opened their gates to Cyrus. The
second version is different. When, in order to take
Babylon, Cyrus had made a trench to receive the
water of the Euphrates, which flows through the
city, he led away the army from the walls. The
Babylonians believed that Cyrus had abandoned the
siege, and they became negligent in keeping watch on
the walls. But after drawing off the water, Cyrus
led the Persians through the old bed, and unexpectedly
made himself master of the city.</p>

<p>Besides these accounts of the Greeks, proclamations
of the Hebrews, which are joined on to the
prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, give indications
on the fall of Babel. "Behold, saith Jehovah, I will
dry up their sea and parch their fountains. When
they are heated I will prepare a drink for them, and
intoxicate them, so that they make merry, that they
may sleep an everlasting sleep, and awake no more.
And behold! there came mounted men. The night
of my pleasure was turned to horror. The watchman
wakes, the table is prepared, there is eating and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
drinking. Rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.
Their dwellings are set on fire, the bars are broken.
One runs to meet another, and messenger to meet
messenger, bringing news to the king of Babylon
that his city is captured on every side; the channels
are taken, the lakes they have burned with fire.
Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and all her idols are
trampled underfoot. The whole earth rests, and
is at peace, the lands break forth into joy. The
cypresses are glad over thee, the cedars of Lebanon;
now that thou art fallen, no one will come to cut us
down."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The kings of Babylon, like those of Asshur,
used the cedars of Lebanon for their palaces; Nebuchadnezzar
himself tells us that he caused cedars to
be felled in Lebanon for his palace (III. 386). A
later book of the Hebrews, the Book of Daniel, which
was written in the first century <small>B.C.</small>, under Antiochus
Epiphanes (176-164 <small>B.C.</small>), about the year 167 <small>B.C.</small>,
represents Babylon as taken by the Persians during
the night of a festival, but Darius, not Cyrus, is the
Persian king. Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,
is king of Babylon. He gives a great banquet
to his thousand mighty men, and, heated by wine,
causes the gold and silver vessels to be brought which
Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple at
Jerusalem; and his mighty men, their wives and
concubines, drink out of them, and sing songs of praise
to their gods of gold and silver, brass, iron, stone, and
wood. Then suddenly a hand writes letters on the
wall of the palace. The king changes colour; the
wise men of Babylon, the Chald&aelig;ans, the magicians,
and prophets were brought, but they cannot read the
writing. Then Daniel was summoned, one of the
Jews whom Nebuchadnezzar brought from Babylon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
who had already interpreted dreams for Nebuchadnezzar
which the wise men of Babylon could not
expound, and had remained true to the religion of
Jehovah under all temptations. He read the words,
which were Hebrew,&mdash;Mene, Tekel, Peres,&mdash;and explained
them: Thy kingdom is "numbered"; thou
hast been "weighed" in the balance and found
wanting, because thy heart is not humbled, and thou
honourest not the God in whose hand is thy breath
and all thy fortunes; thy kingdom has been "divided"
among the Medes and Persians. Then the king commanded
to put the purple robe on Daniel, and the
golden chain upon his neck, and proclaim him third
in the kingdom. "But in that night was Belshazzar
the king of the Chald&aelig;ans slain, and Darius the
Mede received the kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Only a short excerpt has come down to us of the
account which Berosus gave of the capture of Babylon.
"Cyrus set out from Persia with a strong force against
Babylon. When Nabonetus heard of his approach,
he went to meet him with his army, and they joined
battle. He was defeated, and fled with a few companions
into the city of the Borsippeans, where he
was besieged. Cyrus took Babylon, and as he had
found the city difficult to reduce, and stubborn, he
gave orders to throw down the walls outside the city,
and then set out against Borsippa in order to get
Nabonetus into his power, by bringing the siege to
an end. But Nabonetus did not wait for the city to
be taken by storm; he surrendered. Cyrus treated
him with kindness, and sent him from Babylon to
Carmania, which he appointed to be his dwelling-place.
There Nabonetus lived for the remainder of
his life, and there he died." According to Eusebius,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Cyrus gave the vice-royalty of Carmania to Nabonetus,
and Darius took it away again.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>After all that has been observed above, the attack
of Cyrus could not be unexpected by Nabonetus, and
we also see from Herodotus that it had been long
foreseen, and provisions for many years had been
collected in Babylon&mdash;according to Xenophon there
was sufficient for twenty years. We find, moreover,
that the fortifications of the city had been completed;
the great extent which Nebuchadnezzar had allowed
for the wall of the city must have enclosed a wide
breadth of country, or at any rate pastures large
enough to maintain numerous herds of cattle. And
Nebuchadnezzar had not merely made the metropolis
the fortress and strong camp of the kingdom, which
could both receive and protect the military forces, he
had covered the northern edge of the Babylonian
land by a fortification of a hundred feet in height
and twenty in thickness, which extended from the
Euphrates to the Tigris. Behind this wall were the
four great canals which connected the Euphrates and
Tigris; and, protected by the great wall, there lay on
the Euphrates at Sepharvaim, the reservoirs by which
the level of the Euphrates could be raised or lowered,
and the canals fed&mdash;the basin of which Nebuchadnezzar
had availed himself in building his bridge
over the Euphrates,&mdash;works which Herodotus, we do
not know on what authority, but very erroneously
ascribes to Nitocris, a queen of Babylon. By this
wall, and the canals, which it would be necessary to
dam up, any attack on the heart of Babylonia from
the direction of Mesopotamia would be rendered
almost impossible. The Tigris after leaving the
mountains of Armenia, above the ruins of Nineveh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
is not difficult to cross in the summer, yet an attack
from this side would encounter almost insuperable
difficulties, and even if they were overcome the
attacking army would be involved in a labyrinth of
canals, in which the cavalry of the Persians could be
of little use. Hence Babylonia could only be reached
by crossing the Tigris and Euphrates below that fortification
and the canals,&mdash;a difficult task. If Cyrus
attempted to cross both rivers above this point, and
then march down the western shore till he was below
the "Median wall," he would sacrifice altogether his
communication with Persia, he would have to march
southwards through the Syrian desert, and then force
the passage of the Euphrates, in the neighbourhood
of the metropolis, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the face of the enemy's
power, while he at the same time would find himself
in the midst of an extensive system of canals, and
of the swamps which lie along the Euphrates between
Babylon and the sea (I. 300, III. 359).</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Cyrus could only cross
the Tigris from the east, and attempt an attack below
the wall which united the two rivers. This was the
line which, in fact, he followed. Berosus told us
that Cyrus "marched from Persia against Nabonetus,"
and Herodotus exhibits him as occupied for a whole
summer on the Diala. His occupation there, as Herodotus
describes it, is very unintelligible; the Diala
was punished by being divided into 360 canals, and
so made fordable. That Cyrus should punish a river
is both unlikely in itself and opposed to the religious
conceptions of Iran, which as we know required the
greatest respect to be paid to rivers; more improbable
still and indeed impossible is it in the midst of the
war against Babylon. If we do not assume that the
source from which Herodotus drew has wrongly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
brought a great work of irrigation which Cyrus undertook
for the land of the Diala at some other time
into connection with this war against Babylon, it
must be the passage of the Tigris which is in question.
What we know of the military achievements of Cyrus
does not allow us to suppose that when once in the
field he would give his opponents the respite of a
whole summer. If we could assume that the army
of Nabonetus had contested the crossing with Cyrus
at this point, above the mouth of the Diala, where
at a later time the Babylonians attempted to check
Darius&mdash;and that they had ships of war in the Tigris
then, as at the time of Darius&mdash;we might then suppose
that Cyrus reached the Tigris above the mouth
of the Diala, and not being able to force the crossing,
attempted to carry off the water of the river into
the Diala, above and behind his camp, and at length
succeeded in his attempt. Even then the number of
the canals is very remarkable. But whether the
supposition is right or wrong, in any case we may
assume on the basis of the narrative of Herodotus
that Cyrus began the war against Babylon in the
spring of the year 539 <small>B.C.</small>, that he crossed the Tigris
in the neighbourhood of the Diala, and that the only
result of his first campaign was to effect the passage
of the Tigris and retain command of the river. From
this point, in the next spring, he led his army, as
Herodotus states, in a diagonal across Babylonia towards
the city. Nabonetus lost the battle, which, as
Herodotus says, was fought in the neighbourhood of
Babylon. Of Nabonetus and his fate the historian
says not a word; we have therefore no reason to
doubt the statement of Berosus, that Nabonetus did
not again return to Babylon, but took refuge in
Borsippa with a few companions, and was there be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>sieged.
It was obviously of great advantage to Cyrus
to prevent the Babylonians from entering into their
city, to drive away the army or part of it from the
city in order to diminish the number of those who
could defend the walls. He might accomplish this
object by strengthening his right wing and advancing
with it. If Nabonetus and a part of the fugitives were
thus cut off from Babylon, he could only retire southwards
beyond the Euphrates into the city nearest
Babylon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> into Borsippa, to seek protection at the
great temple of Nebo (I. 291), the god whose name
he bore.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The command in Babylon then devolved
on his eldest son Bil-sar-ussur (p. 67). It follows
from the narrative of Berosus that Cyrus quickly
followed up the defeated army of the Babylonians,
that a part of the Persians, treading on the heels of
the fugitives, crossed the Euphrates below the city,
to invest Borsippa and the metropolis on the western
side. Berosus has told us that Cyrus marched against
Babylon with a great force. His army must indeed
have been strong enough to enclose the second circuit
of the city, 35 or 40 miles (III. 372), to meet the
attack of the whole force of the besieged on both
sides of the river, and blockade Borsippa.</p>

<p>But the inhabitants "ridiculed the siege," and
Cyrus could make no progress&mdash;such is the account
in Herodotus and Xenophon. Owing to the amount
of provisions at the command of the city, an investment
could not promise any result, and there was
little prospect of storming the city. The broad and
deep trenches in front of the walls made it impossible
to undermine them; even if these could be filled up
under the missiles of the enemy in a few places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
for the battering-rams to be brought forward, the
strength of the walls was so great that they could
not be broken. Still less possible was it to mount
them. They were so high that the arrows of the
besiegers could not reach them with force, and even if
the attack was carried successfully over the trenches,
no towers or ladders would be at once strong and
high enough to bring the storming party to the
turrets. According to Herodotus, a long time had
elapsed before Cyrus formed his plan. He bethought
himself of the basin which Nebuchadnezzar had excavated
at Sepharvaim, for the regulation of the
inundations of the Euphrates, for feeding and damming
up the canals; this work constructed for the
benefit and protection of the land he used for the
destruction of the capital. The Euphrates was to be
led off into this basin till its bed could be forded at
Babylon. Then the storming of the city was to be
attempted from the river, the walls on the banks being
less high and strong. For this object it was necessary
to obtain possession of the fortress of Sepharvaim,
which guarded the sluices of the basin, to deepen
or enlarge the basin itself, so that for a certain
period it could receive the whole mass of water;
it was also requisite that the canal which led into
it should be widened and deepened; and lastly the
course of the river beneath the basin, or rather beneath
the great canals which led into the Tigris,
must be barred by a dam, if the Euphrates was to
flow into it. The army of Cyrus must have been so
strong, that after leaving behind a sufficient number
of men on both sides of the Euphrates to continue
the blockade of the city and of Borsippa, it could
detach an adequate force of troops and workmen
to Sepharvaim. Before these works could be begun,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the inundation which in June and July the Euphrates
pours over the plain of Babylon must have been
over; and before the return of the inundation in the
autumn, which would imperil the whole undertaking,
Sepharvaim must be captured, the Euphrates drawn
off, and Babylon conquered. When Sepharvaim was
in the hand of Cyrus, the stream, which had previously
been dammed up with the exception of a
small passage, must have been rapidly closed, that
the Babylonians might not have their suspicions
roused by the fall of the water, and guard the walls
on the river with redoubled vigilance. The time was
short. Pliny has preserved for us the statement that
the large city of Agranis, which lay on the Euphrates,
where the canal Nahr Malka (III. 359) flowed out
of the river, was destroyed by the Persians; the
walls of the city of Sepharvaim which had been
rendered famous by the wisdom of the Chald&aelig;ans
(Sippara, I. 245), were also destroyed by the Persians,
and Gobares (Gobryas), as some say, had drawn off
the Euphrates.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> To Gobryas Xenophon also allots an
important share in the capture of Babylon (p. 78).
Even without these statements of Pliny, which support
the account of Herodotus, and inform us of
the battles which the Persians had to fight on the
Euphrates above Babylon in order to establish themselves
at the entrance of the Nahr Malka, and get
the mouth of the basin into their power&mdash;even without
the hints of the prophets of the Hebrews about the
"drying up of the springs," and "parching of the
channels," and the remark of Polyaenus about the
drawing off of the Euphrates at a marsh (the basin of
Sepharvaim was, when not filled, a marsh), we must
reject Xenophon's account of the drawing off of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Euphrates. Conceding the extent of the walls of
Babylon, even if limited to one bank of the river,
the work could not have been done in a year; and
every day the execution of the work under the eyes
of the besieged would have made its object more
plain.</p>

<p>The plan of Cyrus succeeded. The removal of
Agranis and Sepharvaim made the execution possible;
the number of hands at his disposal caused all the
works to be carried out at the right time, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> before
the inundation of the autumn. The storming of the
city could be attempted by the river-bed both above
and below the city.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> That it took place and was
accomplished on the night of a festival, is stated in
the narratives of Herodotus and Xenophon, and indicated
by the Hebrew prophet in the words "the
night of my pleasure was turned to horror," and other
phrases (p. 80); and the book of Daniel makes the
same assertion. Aristotle is of opinion that even three
days after, a third part of the population did not
know that the city had been taken.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Xenophon
represents the division of Gobryas as the first to reach
the palace; the king falls when defending himself
against their attack. By the palace is here meant
one of the two royal citadels, either the older on the
western bank, or the more recent on the eastern bank
of the Euphrates, the palace of Nabopolassar and
Nebuchadnezzar (III. 375), and the king whom he
represents as slain there, must have been Bil-sar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ussur,
the son and heir of Nabonetus. As we have
observed, the book of Daniel calls the king who lost
his throne and life on the night of the festival,
Belshazzar. In addition to him, Nabonetus had a
second son, named Nebuchadnezzar (see below, chap,
xiv.). Besides the palace of the king, Xenophon
speaks of citadels of Babylon which surrendered to
the conqueror on the following morning.</p>

<p>After the capture of the metropolis, which was
followed by the surrender of Borsippa, and the capture
of Nabonetus (538 <small>B.C.</small>), Cyrus, so far as we can tell,
showed clemency both towards the king, whom he
caused to be taken to Carmania, and to the city of
Babylon. The kings of Asshur treated besieged
princes and conquered cities in a manner very different
from that in which Cyrus treated Astyages,
Cr&#339;sus and Sardis, Nabonetus and Babylon. Babylonia
was not oppressed; the city was not destroyed.
Cyrus stepped into the place of the native king. The
Babylonian tablets after the capture of the city and
the fall of the kingdom, date from the years of the
reign of Cyrus over Babylonia, the years "of Kurus,
king of Babylon, king of the lands."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The city of
Babylon retained her temples and palaces and her
mighty walls. Herodotus tells us expressly that
Cyrus did no injury to the walls or the gates of
Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and twenty years afterwards we find the
city in possession of her impregnable works. Xenophon
remarks that Cyrus placed troops in the
citadels, set captains over them, left behind a sufficient
garrison in the city and charged the inhabitants
with the maintenance of it; the arrangements then
made for keeping guard were in existence still.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> If,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
therefore, the excerpt of Josephus from Berosus tells
us that Cyrus destroyed the walls "outside the city,"
this can only refer to the great wall which Nebuchadnezzar
had built from the Euphrates to the Tigris
above Sepharvaim, as a protection against an attack
from the north. It would have been a heavy task
to level with the ground this fortification throughout
its entire length of from 60 to 75 miles, the Persians
therefore contented themselves with making large
breaches in it. The wall was in this condition when
Xenophon came with the ten thousand to Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The fall of the metropolis had decided the fortune
of the Babylonian kingdom, and the provinces. The
most important of these was Syria, with the great
trading places of the Phenicians on the Mediterranean;
we remember how many and what severe
struggles the subjection of Syria had cost Nebuchadnezzar.
At the present moment the approach of the
Persians was enough to cause Syria to recognise the
supremacy of Cyrus almost without a blow. Herodotus
tells us that the Phenicians voluntarily submitted to
the Persians; Xenophon mentions that Cyrus had
subjugated the Phenicians; Polybius observes that
Gaza alone among all the cities of Syria offered resistance;
the rest, terrified at the approach of the
Persians and the greatness of their power, had surrendered
themselves and their lands to them. With
the capture of Gaza Cyrus stood on the borders of
Egypt. As we have seen, Nebuchadnezzar allowed
the states and cities of Syria to retain their native
princes, so long as these preserved their fidelity to
him; even over the Phenician cities he and his
successors placed men of their own royal or priestly
families to be at once judges or princes of the cities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and viceroys of Babylon. That Tyre surrendered
without a struggle, as Herodotus and Polybius tell us
of Syria, that Cyrus, like Nebuchadnezzar before him,
left the princes who submitted in command, follows
from the fact that Hiram, whom Nabonetus had made
king of Tyre, continued to reign over the city under
Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> If Cyrus felt himself compelled to establish
princes in the Greek cities of the coast for the first
time, who owed their position to him, and could not
maintain it without his aid, the cities of Ph&#339;nicia
had long been accustomed to receive these princes
from distant sovereigns. Cyrus and his successors
confined themselves in their choice to the old royal
families of the Phenician cities; at any rate we find,
even under the Ach&aelig;menids, men with the hereditary
names at the head of Tyre and Sidon. Yet the
relations of the Phenician cities did not remain without
change. Cyrus, as it seems, availed himself of
the old rivalry between Tyre and Sidon to win a
further support for his power. Ever since the foundation
of Gades, and the times of the first Hiram of
Tyre, the contemporary of Solomon, Sidon had been
gradually forced by Tyre into the second place; under
the Persian kingdom Sidon again appears as the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
city of Ph&#339;nicia, and her kings have the precedence
of those of Tyre and the other cities.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> To the population
on the whole the change to the Persian dominion
would be regarded with indifference if not with
pleasure; a connection with the Persian empire
opened a far more extensive market for trade, and
secured and protected intercourse over a far greater
extent of country than the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>The ancient kingdom of Babylon, in which the
civilisation of the Semitic stock had taken root some
fifteen centuries previously, and had attained to such
peculiar development, which had struggled so long and
stubbornly against the younger kingdom of Assyria,
and when it finally succumbed, had been raised
to yet greater power than it had ever attained to in
old times, under the brilliant reigns of Nabopolassar
and Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;which had united the branches
of the Semitic stem from the Tigris to the Mediterranean,
from the foot of the Armenian mountains to
the deserts of Arabia&mdash;had succumbed to the attack
of Cyrus after a brief existence, sixty-nine years after
the fall of Nineveh. The predominance exercised for
so many centuries by Semitic culture and Semitic
arms through the old Babylonian, the Assyrian, and
the second Babylonian kingdom, passed to a tribe
of different character, language, and culture&mdash;to the
Arians of Iran.</p>

<p>It was this violent change, which brought to a
Semitic tribe liberation for its fellow Semites. The
hopes of the Jews were at last fulfilled. The fall of
Babylon had avenged the fall of Jerusalem, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
subjugation of Syria to the armies of Babylon opened
the way for their return. Cyrus did not belie the
confidence which the Jews had so eagerly offered him;
without hesitation he gave the exiles permission to
return and erect again their shrine at Jerusalem. The
return of the captives and the foundation of a new
state of the Jews was very much to his interest; it
might contribute to support his empire in Syria. He
did not merely count on the gratitude of the returning
exiles, but as any revival of the Babylonian kingdom,
or rebellion of the Syrians against the Persian empire,
imperilled the existence of this community, which
had not only to be established anew, but would never
be very strong, it must necessarily oppose any such
attempts. Forty-nine years&mdash;seven Sabbatical years,
instead of the ten announced by Jeremiah&mdash;had passed
since the destruction of Jerusalem, and more than sixty
since Jeremiah had first announced the seventy years
of servitude to Babylon. Cyrus commissioned Zerubbabel,
the son of Salathiel, a grandson of Jechoniah,
the king who had been carried away captive, and
therefore a scion of the ancient royal race, and a
descendant of David, to be the leader of the returning
exiles, to establish them in their abode, and be the
head of the community;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> he bade his treasurer Mithridates
give out to him the sacred vessels, which
Nebuchadnezzar had carried away as trophies to
Babylon, and placed in the temple of Bel; there are
said to have been more than 5000 utensils of gold
and silver, baskets, goblets, cups, knives, etc. But
all the Jews in Babylon did not avail themselves
of the permission. Like the Israelites deported by
Sargon into Media and Assyria some 180 years previously,
many of the Jews brought to Mesopotamia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and Babylonia at the time of Jechoniah and Zedekiah,
had found there a new home, which they preferred
to the land of their fathers. But the priests (to the
number of more than 3000<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>), many of the families
of the heads of the tribes, all who cared for the
sanctuary and the old country, all in whom Jehovah
"awoke the spirit," as the Book of Ezra says, began
the march over the Euphrates. With Zerubbabel was
Joshua, the high priest, the most distinguished among
all the Jews, a grandson of the high priest Zeraiah,
whom Nebuchadnezzar had executed after the capture
of Jerusalem. The importance of the priests had
increased in the captivity; they had become the
natural heads and judges of the Jews, and the people
following the guidance of the prophets, had learned to
regard Jehovah as their peculiar lord and king. It
was a considerable multitude which left the land
"beyond the stream," the waters of Babylon, to sit
once more under the fig-tree in their ancient home,
and build up the city of David and the temple of
Jehovah from their ruins; 42,360 freemen, with 7337
Hebrew men-servants and maid-servants; their goods
were carried by 435 camels, 736 horses, 250 mules, and
6720 asses (537 <small>B.C.</small>)<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The exodus of the Jews from
Babylon is accompanied by a prophet with cries of
joy, and announcements filled with the wildest hopes.
Was not the fall of Babylon and the return home a
sure pledge that the anger of Jehovah was appeased?
Must not the dawn of that brilliant time be come,
which the prophets had always pointed out behind the
execution of the punishment? Could not the most
joyful expectation prevail that Jehovah's grace would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
be greater henceforth than his anger in the past?
Thus, in the spirit, the prophet saw all the scattered
members of the people of Israel, who since the time of
Tiglath-Pilesar II. had been carried away, or fled for
refuge, return from the distant lands, from Egypt and
the isles; Jerusalem has put on a new splendour which
far exceeds that of old days; and therefore he gives
expression to the confident expectation that the
people of Jehovah will be the first nation of the earth,
and the resurgent Zion will be the centre and the
protector of all nations. "Go forth from Babylon,"
he cries; "fly from the land of the Chald&aelig;ans! Proclaim
it with shouts of joy, tell it to the end of the
earth and say: 'Jehovah hath redeemed his servant
Jacob.'"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> "How beautiful upon the mountains are

<p>Such expectations and hopes were far from being
realised. The Edomites had, in the mean-time, extended
their borders, and obtained possession of the South of
Judah, but the land immediately round Jerusalem was
free and no doubt almost depopulated. As the returning
exiles contented themselves with the settlement at
Jerusalem, the towns to the North, Anathoth, Gebah,
Michmash, Kirjath-Jearim, and some others&mdash;only
Bethlehem is mentioned to the South,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> they found
nothing to impede them. Their first care was the
restoration of the worship, according to the law and
custom of their fathers, for which object an altar of
burnt-offerings was erected on the site of the temple,
in order to offer the appointed sacrifice at morning
and evening. The priests, minstrels, and Levites were
separated according to their families, and those who
could not prove their priestly descent were rejected
for the sacred service;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> the attempt was then made
to arrange the rest of the exiles according to their
families, in order to decide their claims and rights
to certain possessions and lands. Then voluntary
gifts were collected from all for the rebuilding of
the temple; contributions even came in from those
who had remained in Babylonia, so that 70,000 pieces
of gold and 5000 min&aelig; of silver are said to have been
amassed. Tyrian masons were hired, and agreements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
made with Tyrian carpenters, to fell cedars in Lebanon,
and bring them to Joppa, for which Cyrus had given
his permission. The foundation of the temple was
laid in the second year of the return (536 <small>B.C.</small>). The
priests appeared in their robes with trumpets, and
the Levites with cymbals, to praise Jehovah; "that
He might be gracious, and His mercy be upon Israel
for ever." Those of the priests and elders who had
seen the old temple are said to have wept aloud; "but
many raised their voices in joy so that the echo was
heard far off."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> We have evidence of the grateful
and elevated tone which filled the exiles in those days,
in songs, where we read: "They pressed upon me in my
youth, but they overpowered me not. The ploughers
ploughed upon my back and made long furrows.
Jehovah is just; he broke the bonds of the wicked.
Praised be Jehovah, who did not give us over as prey
to their teeth; our soul escaped like a bird from the
snare of the fowler. When Jehovah turned again the
captivity of Zion, our way was filled with joy; and
they said among the nations: Jehovah hath done
great things for them! Jehovah hath chosen Zion,
and taken it to be His abode and resting-place for
ever and ever. There He will clothe His priests with
salvation, and exalt the power of David, and clothe
his enemies with shame."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The fortunate beginning of the restoration of the
city and temple soon met with difficulties. The people
of Samaria, who were a mixture of the remnant of the
Israelites and the strangers whom Sargon had brought
there after the capture of Samaria (III. 86), and
Esarhaddon at a later date (III. 154), came to meet the
exiles in a friendly spirit, and offered them assistance,
from which we must conclude that in spite of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
foreign admixture the Israelitish blood and the
worship of Jehovah were preponderant in Samaria.
The new temple would thus have been the common
sanctuary of the united people of Israel. But the
"sons of captivity" were too proud of the sorrows
which they had undergone, and the fidelity which
they had preserved to Jehovah, and their pure
descent, to accept this offer. Hence the old quarrel
between Israel and Judah broke out anew, and the
exiles soon felt the result. After their repulse the
Samaritans set themselves to hinder the building by
force; "they terrified the exiles that they built no
more, and hired counsellors to make the attempt vain
during the whole of the remainder of the reign
of Cyrus."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The reasons which these counsellors
brought forward before Cyrus against the continuation
of the buildings at Jerusalem, would be the same
which were afterwards brought before Artaxerxes
Longimanus; namely, that when Jerusalem and its
walls were finished the city would become rebellious
and disobedient, as it was previously under the kings
of Babylon.</p>

omitted the siege of Gaza in his detailed description of the march of
Cambyses against Egypt, if it had not taken place until then. The
general expression in Herodotus (3, 34) cannot outweigh all these
proofs; it only says with the exaggerated tone of flattery that
Cambyses first placed a fleet on the sea, and claims the subjugation
of Cyprus for him. As a fact Cyrus left the islands of Anatolia,
except Chios and Lesbos, which voluntarily submitted, uninjured, and
did not call on them for a fleet, for which there were many good
reasons from the point of view of a Persian king.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE KINGDOM OF CYRUS.</h3>


<p>We were able to prove that Cyrus, soon after his
victory over Astyages and the Medes, reduced the
Parthians and Hyrcanians beneath his dominion, that
the Caducians, the Armenians, and the Cappadocians
were his subjects before the Lydian war, that his
empire at this period extended to the Halys. How
far he had already advanced towards the Bactrians
and Sacae must remain uncertain, owing to the contradiction
which exists on this point between the
summary narrative of Herodotus and the excerpt from
Ctesias. Afterwards the Lydian war and its sequel
made Cyrus master of the whole of Asia Minor.
Between the Lydian and Babylonian wars Herodotus
represents him as conquering the whole of upper
Asia, one nation after the other, and Berosus as conquering
the whole of Asia. When our knowledge
is so scanty, it is impossible to fix the campaigns
of Cyrus in the East and the West with greater
exactness, or even to ascertain clearly what successes
he achieved in these regions before and after the
Babylonian war. We merely perceive that Elam
was subject to Cyrus before the attack on Babylon
(p. 83), and if a habitation could be allotted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Nabonetus in Carmania, that country must have
been subject before the war which destroyed the
Babylonian kingdom; we may also conclude with
great probability that Cyrus would not have marched
against Babylon before he felt himself secure in the
East. Hence we may assume that Iran was subject
before the Babylonian war, and the campaigns which
resulted in the conquest of the Gandarians and their
northern neighbours, the Sogdiani and Chorasmians,
must be ascribed to the period after this war. Whether
the nations in the north of Armenia, on the isthmus
between the Black and the Caspian Sea, the Saspeires
and Alarodians in the East, and the Colchians and
Phasians in the valley of the Phasis, were reduced by
Cyrus or his immediate successors remains doubtful.
In the East he had conquered the Drangians, Areians,
Arachoti, Gedrosians, and Gandarians, to the south of
the Cabul on the Indus,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and imposed tribute on the
A&ccedil;vakas to the north of the Cabul.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In the land of
the Arachoti he destroyed, as we are told, the city of
Capisa; Darius mentions a city, Kapisakani in Arachosia,
and Capisa is also mentioned elsewhere in
later writers.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Nearchus tells us that Cyrus undertook
a campaign against the land of the Indians; on the
march thither he lost the greater part of his army in
Gedrosia, owing to the desert and the difficulties of the
way; according to the account of the natives Cyrus
and seven men alone remained out of the whole army.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
In his account of Alexander of Macedon, Diodorus
remarks that after he had encamped at Drangiana
(V. 7), he came to the Ariaspi, who were neighbours
to the Gedrosians. These Ariaspi (whose abodes we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
have already discovered in the neighbourhood of the
Etymandros) were called "Benefactors" for the following
reason. On one of his campaigns, Cyrus was
in the desert, and reduced to extreme distress for want
of necessaries; famine compelled his men to eat each
other; till the Ariaspians brought up 30,000 waggons,
filled with provisions. Thus rescued, Cyrus allowed
them immunity from contributions, honoured them
with other presents, and gave them the name of
"Benefactors."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Strabo also tells us that the Ariaspians
received this name from Cyrus, and so does
Arrian, though he gives a different and less appropriate
reason for it, saying that they had assisted Cyrus in
his campaign against the Scyths.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Curtius tells us, as
a reason for the name, that the Ariaspi had aided the
army of Cyrus when suffering from want of provisions
and the cold, with supplies and shelter.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Herodotus
observes that those who had done a service to the
king were called "Orosangians." In Old Bactrian,
<i>Huvarezyanha</i> means the doer of a kind action. Other
instances are not wanting to prove that the Persian
kings followed the example of Cyrus in conferring this
title as a distinction.</p>

<p>We may regard it as certain that Cyrus had gone
beyond Gedrosia and reduced the Gandarians and the
A&ccedil;vakas to the north of the Cabul; that he afterwards
advanced to the Indus, and his army was brought
into great distress in the deserts of Gedrosia, as was
afterwards the case with Alexander's army on his
return from the Indus. The Ariaspians, from the
position of their country, could only be in a position
to bring aid if Cyrus were returning from the Indus,
or if the distress was so great on the outward march<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that he felt himself compelled to return when in
Gedrosia. Megasthenes distinctly states that Cyrus
did not cross the Indus or set foot in India.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In
the north-east he had reduced the Margiani and
Bactrians to lasting obedience. As he had gained a
good frontier in the east on the Indus, he set himself
to obtain a similar frontier in the north-east. The
northern neighbours of the Hyrcanians, Parthians and
Margiani, the Sacae and the Chorasmians on the
lower Oxus, were subject to him. With the conquest
of the Sogdiani on the western slope of the Belurdagh
Cyrus touched the course of the Jaxartes. There,
on a stream running into that river, he built six
citadels and a large fortress to secure the border
against the nomads of the steppes beyond. These,
like the fortress in the land of the Cadusians (V. 388),
bore the name of Cyrus. The Greeks call the
north-eastern Cyrus, Cyreshata, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the farthest Cyrus
(V. 22).</p>

<p>From the mountains of his native land Cyrus had
subjugated in thirty years three great kingdoms&mdash;Media,
Lydia, and Babylonia; he had conquered Asia
from the shore of the &AElig;gean Sea to the Indus, and
from the brook of Egypt to the shores of the Black and
Caspian Seas and the banks of the Jaxartes. None
of the conquerors before him&mdash;no Pharaoh of Egypt&mdash;none
of the ancient kings of Elam or Babylon, or of
the restless sovereigns of Assyria, nor even the Mede
Cyaxares&mdash;had achieved results which could be distantly
compared with the successes of Cyrus. And
he had done more than merely subdue this region; he
had understood how to maintain his conquests; he was
not compelled like the rulers of Assyria to begin each
year a new struggle against his defeated opponents;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
in his unbounded empire he knew how to institute
arrangements which ensured an existence of two
whole centuries. Hence it would be of great service
to know more precisely what his regulations were for
the management of his empire. But we are almost
entirely without information about them. We can
only attempt to draw conclusions from certain hints
supplied by tradition as to the form which Cyrus
gave to his dominions. We have already remarked
that the Greeks ascribed to Cyrus the foundation of
excellent institutions, and placed him by the side of
Lycurgus; they maintained that at the time of Cyrus
the Persians were in a condition midway between
slavery and freedom. Arrian observes that the Persians,
with whom Cyrus deprived the Medes of the
empire and subjugated the remaining nations of Asia
partly by arms and partly by voluntary submission,
were poor and the inhabitants of a rugged country,
and obeyed regulations which made their training
like that of the Spartans.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> We can plainly see that
the kingdom rested on the power and devotion of the
Persians; they were the ruling tribe beside the
sovereign, and in addition to the proud consciousness
that they were the lords of the empire Cyrus allowed
them to enjoy the fruits and advantages of dominion.
The Persians were free from contributions and taxes
for the empire, they had only to render military
service. Xenophon tells us that in the time of Cyrus
the owners of land furnished excellent horsemen, who
took the field; the rest served for pay. The garrisons
in the fortresses were composed of Persians who
were handsomely treated.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The Greeks have already
told us that Cyrus permitted the Persians to express
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>their opinions freely and openly, and paid honour to
those who gave good counsel, and if they assert that
no one rewarded services more liberally (V. 390), these
rewards would mainly fall into the hands of the
Persians. From the Persians were first and chiefly
elected the captains of the armies, the commanders
of the contingents which the subject nations had to
furnish, and the viceroys who governed the conquered
provinces. Yet nearer to the king stood the six princes
of the Persian tribes (the prince of the Pasargadae
was the king), the descendants of those who in union
with Achaemenes had once governed the Persian
nation. Like the king himself they wore the upright
tiara; from their families the king had to choose his
legitimate wife, while his daughters were married to
the sons of the tribal princes.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The wife of Cyrus was
the daughter of the tribal prince Pharnaspes. The
chiefs of the Persians were the nearest to the throne;
they entered into the king's presence unannounced,
and no doubt formed with the king the chief council
of the kingdom. Besides this chief council there
was a supreme court of seven judges. These, as
Herodotus tells us, were chosen men, who had to
pronounce sentence for the Persians, and explain the
customs of the fathers; and "everything was brought
before them." They held their office for life, unless
convicted of injustice.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> We also find that the son
succeeded the father. But even these judges were
subject to the supervision and authority of the king,
and if it was proved that any of them had received
bribes he inflicted the severest penalties.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>"At the time of the Medes," Herodotus tells us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
"the nations ruled over each other; the Medes ruled
over all, and directly over those nearest to them;
these again over their neighbours, who in their turn
ruled over those who lay on their borders. In the
same way the Persians estimate the value of nations.
They consider themselves by far the best of all
nations; next in order come those who live nearest
to them, and those who are most remote are held in
least estimation."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> If Herodotus has here correctly
represented the self-consciousness of the Persians his
statement also obviously implies the pride of race, the
community of language and religion, which united
the Persians with the kindred nations of the Iranian
table-land, and most closely with the Medes, and
the nations of Western Iran. This feeling presented
itself to Cyrus as a valuable political consideration,
and he felt himself called upon to win for his
kingdom the Medes as the nation nearest akin to
the Persians and more numerous. With this view
he spared and respected Astyages, took his daughter
into his house, and made her his wife, and even in the
first decade of his reign had no hesitation in appointing
Medes as generals and viceroys; the custom of his
successors, to reside for some time in Ecbatana, in
order by this means to attach the Medes to the
kingdom, must, no doubt, go back to Cyrus.</p>

<p>But even towards the conquered nations of alien
race, language, and religion Cyrus conducted himself
in a manner very different from the manner of the
kings of Asshur before him. Their kings were not
executed, their cities were not burnt, and their
religion and worship were left uninjured. On the
other hand Cyrus did not content himself with the
homage of the conquered princes, nor did he, like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>Assyrians, allow men of the same nation to take
their place. Execution, cruel treatment, imprisonment
of the conquered prince, alone or with his family, could
only embitter the conquered nation against the conqueror.
The continuance of the conquered prince in
power only supplied them with the impulse and
means to recover their former independence, and
princes chosen in their place from the midst of the
subjects would soon follow the lead of the national
tendencies, and their own ambition. Astyages, Cr&#339;sus,
and Nabonetus received residences and possessions in
distant regions, which allowed them to live in dignity
and opulence; and where the throne remained in the
families of the native rulers in districts of moderate
extent which had submitted voluntarily, as in Cilicia
and the cities of the Phenicians, this was not done
without certain limitations and safe regulations.
Cyrus set viceroys over the parts of his empire, who
were supplied with troops in moderate numbers.
The chief cities, such as Sardis and Babylon, like
the border fortresses, were secured by garrisons of
Persian troops. Cyrus did not impose heavy burdens
on the conquered nations; he left it to themselves
to fix the amount of the yearly contributions which
they should pay into his treasury, though it is
true that the amount of the favour they had to
expect from the king depended on the tribute. The
viceroys were subordinate to the king, but with
this restriction they exercised supreme authority in
the regions over which they presided. Their main
duty was to preserve the province in obedience and
peace. Whether the command that they were to
look after the development of agriculture, and the
growth of the population, is traceable to Cyrus
(V. 206), we cannot decide, but we see clearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
that the various communities and regions managed
their own affairs independently, and governed themselves.
The local political institutions were not
attacked and removed any more than the religious.
It was of no importance whether the local organisation
was dynastic or republican, though in more
important communities such as the Greek cities&mdash;the
Anatolian, and the Phenician cities on the Syrian
coast, Cyrus gave the preference to the dynastic
form, inasmuch as the dynasties there were compelled
to seek from the king the support necessary for
maintaining their power. If princes of the old royal
families were set up over the cities of the Phenicians,
the rise of party leaders to a princely position was
favoured among the Greeks. The local interests of
one town were also advanced against those of another,
<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> the interests of Sidon against those of Tyre, and
the interests of Miletus against the other cities. The
persons thus favoured were by this means closely
connected with the kingdom; in the event of a
change of dominion they had to fear the loss of the
privileges which they had attained. Moreover Cyrus
had at hand rewards and distinctions of merit, not for
the Persians only, but also for his subjects in other
nations. Xenophon lays stress on the liberality of
Cyrus towards those who had done him good service
as the chief means by which he established and
strengthened his empire, and if he tells us that the
kings of Persia had continued what Cyrus had begun,
we may certainly assume that the magnificent list
of distinctions and honours, which we find in use
at a later time in the Persian empire, goes back to
Cyrus. The merits which whole regions and tribes
had done to the king were also rewarded. We have
already seen that the title "Benefactors," with which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
largesses in land were joined,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> was given not only
to distinguished men but also to tribes. "What conqueror
except Cyrus," asks Xenophon, "has been
called Father by his subjects, a name which is
obviously given not to the plunderer but to the
Benefactor?" By gentleness and liberality he induced
men to prefer him to son, or brother, or father. As
he cared for his subjects and treated them as a father,
so did they honour him as a father. In this way
he was able to reign alone, and rule according to his
own will his kingdom which was the greatest and
most splendid of all.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Though this description of Xenophon is idealised,
though even the more sober statements of the Greeks,
the words of Plato already quoted, the statements of
Herodotus, that the Persians held no one to be the
equal of Cyrus, that they called him father because
he had ruled them with a father's gentleness and had
provided them with all good things,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and the opinion
of Aeschylus who speaks of Cyrus as a wise and right-minded
man, primarily represent the grateful memory
which the Persians cherished of the founder of their
kingdom, Cyrus is undoubtedly the least bloody among
the conquerors and founders of empires known to the
history of the East. His object was not to terrify the
conquered nations and hold them in check by arms,
but to reconcile them to the new government. In
Babylon he simply took the place of the native king;
like him, he took measures for the maintenance of
the great temples of the land; on a brick found at
Senkereh we read: "Kuras, maintainer of Bit-Saggatu"
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the great temple of Merodach at Babylon) "and
Bit-Zida" (the temple of Nebo at Borsippa), "son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Kambuziya, I, the king."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Hence he not only left
his subjects their religion and rites, but was careful
of them. In the same way their administration of
justice remained undisturbed, and so far as possible
he allowed them to rule themselves. He did not
attempt to exhaust their means; on the contrary,
agriculture and trade were favoured, and wherever
a rebellion was attempted and suppressed, the supression
was not followed by any sanguinary punishment.
In spite of our defective information we may still
recognise some trace of his keen and unerring political
insight. The manner in which he organised his
empire deserves the higher praise because it is the
product of his own mind, and not a copy of any
pattern. The grounds for the clemency and moderation
by which he was guided, we must seek not
only in the religious views of Iran, but to a still
greater degree in his character and his political conceptions.
That along with the effort to satisfy the
Persians and win the hearts of his subjects,&mdash;with the
clever opposition of interests, and most lavish application
of rewards and distinctions,&mdash;Cyrus did not
neglect real support and means of power, is proved
by the care which Xenophon represents him as bestowing
on the army, the fortification of Pasargadae,
the garrisons in the chief cities of the subject lands,
the fortresses on the borders of the kingdom. The
commanders in all these places, no less than the
"chiliarchs" of the garrisons, were nominated directly
by Cyrus, the lists of the garrisons were brought
before the king. The arrangement of the Persian
army in divisions of ten battalions of a thousand men
each, which were again broken up into ten companies,
with seven corporals each, is attributed by Xenophon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to Cyrus. He put an end to all skirmishing with horsemen
cavalry, by clothing cavalry and horses in mail,
and supplying each soldier with a javelin only, so that
they fought man against man; the infantry he armed
with the wicker, leather-covered shield, battle-axe, and
knife, also with a view to close fighting.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> To meet the
costs of government and the army, Cyrus collected
a large treasure, which he deposited in his palace at
Pasargadae. Pliny has preserved the statement that
the conquest of Asia yielded to Cyrus 24,000 pounds
of gold besides that which had been manufactured,
and the golden vessels, and 500,000 talents of silver.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Though this statement may be exaggerated, the gold
accumulated by Alyattes and Cr&#339;sus at Sardis, the
treasures of the royal palaces at Ecbatana and Babylon,
all of which fell into the hands of Cyrus, were not
inconsiderable. In both these latter places the booty
of Assyria was collected, and in Babylon the booty
of Syria and the tribute of the Phenicians. In any
case the treasure which Cyrus deposited at Pasargadae
provided abundant means for a long time to satisfy
the most extravagant needs of the empire, the court,
and the army, and to recompense every deed of merit
with gold. The treasures which Alexander, after a long
period of decline in Persia, found at Susa, Persepolis,
Ecbatana, and Pasargadae, are estimated by the Greeks
at 180,000 talents, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> at more than &pound;40,000,000,
and beside this there were the gold and silver ornaments
of the citadel (V. 309), and a large amount
of manufactured gold and silver. What Alexander
left of the latter in Susa alone afterwards provided
Antigonus with 15,000 talents.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Concerning the death of Cyrus," so Herodotus
tells us, "there are many narratives, but the most
probable in my mind is the following: When he
had reduced the Babylonians, he wished to conquer
the Massaget&aelig; also. There were many things which
impelled him to this: in the first place his birth, by
which he considered himself more than human. Then
the success which had attended him in all his wars;
for whatever the nation against which he directed his
army it was unable to withstand him. The Massaget&aelig;
were said to be a great and brave nation; some call
them Scythians. They dwell beyond the Araxes
(Jaxartes: Herodotus confuses this river with the
Aras), towards the morning and sunrise. The Caspian
Sea is a sea by itself, fifteen days' journey in length
and eight in breadth; on the west side of the sea is
the Caucasus, but towards the east it is bounded by a
plain of unlimited extent. A considerable part of this
plain was occupied by the Massaget&aelig;. They wear a
dress like that of the Scythians, and resemble them in
their mode of life; they fight on horse and on foot,
use the bow and the lance, and also carry battle-axes.
The points of their lances and arrows and their axes
are made of copper, as also are the corslets of the
horses. But for their girdles, for the adornment of
the head and shoulders, as well as for the bits, cheek-pieces,
and curbs of their horses, they use gold. Silver
and iron they do not possess, these metals are not found
in the country, but gold and copper in abundance.
Each man marries one wife, but they have their wives
in common, and when any one desires to lie with a
woman he hangs his quiver on her waggon, and no
attack is made upon him. Those who reach a great
age are put to death by their relations, who assemble
for that purpose, cooked along with sheep's flesh, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
eaten; this they consider the most fortunate lot.
Those who die of sickness are not eaten but buried,
and they look on it as a misfortune not to be killed.
They do not cultivate the soil, but live on their herds
and on fish, which the Araxes supplies in large quantities,
and drink milk. Of the gods they worship the
sun only, and to him they sacrifice horses, because they
think that the swiftest animal should be offered to the
swiftest deity. At that time a woman, Tomyris by
name, was queen of the Massaget&aelig;, her husband being
dead. Cyrus sent to her under pretext of an offer of
marriage; he wished to make her his wife. But
Tomyris perceived that it was not her, but the
kingdom of the Massaget&aelig;, that he wanted, and
refused the offer. As cunning was of no avail, Cyrus
marched openly against the Massaget&aelig;, threw a bridge
of boats over the Araxes in order to carry his army
across, and caused towers to be built on the merchant-men
which were to form a bridge over the river.
While he was occupied with this, Tomyris sent him a
herald, saying: 'O, king of the Persians, desist from
the undertaking which thou hast begun, for thou
knowest not whether thou wilt bring it to a good
end. Desist, and rule over what is thine, leaving us
to govern what is ours. But thou wilt take no heed
of these exhortations, but rather do anything than
remain at rest. If thou eagerly desirest to make
trial of the Massaget&aelig;, desist from making this bridge
over the river; enter upon our land; we will retire
three days' march from the river; or if thou wouldst
rather have us in thy land, do thou the same.' When
Cyrus heard this he collected the chiefs of the Persians
in order to consult with them what he should do.
Their advice was all to one purport; he was to allow
Tomyris and her army to come into his land. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Cr&#339;sus, the Lydian, who was present, dissented from
this advice. 'If we allow the enemy to come into the
land,' he said to Cyrus, there will be danger: 'Shouldst
thou be defeated, the whole empire will be ruined.
The victorious Massaget&aelig; will never retire, but invade
thy lands, and shouldst thou be victorious, thou wilt
not reap such results as if thou wert to defeat the
Massaget&aelig; beyond the river, for then thou couldst
advance into the dominion of Tomyris. Besides, it is
shameful and disgraceful that the son of Cambyses
should retire before a woman. For this reason it
seems to me right to cross the river and advance as
far as they retire, and there attempt to gain the
victory over them. As I am told, the Massaget&aelig; are
not acquainted with the luxuries of the Persians; they
have no experience of enjoyment. We must prepare
a meal for them in our camp, slaying and dressing
sheep, and placing at hand goblets of unmixed wine,
and various kinds of food; then leave behind the
weakest part of the army and retire to the river. If
I am not deceived, they will seize upon the provisions
when they see them, and we shall be in a position
to do great things.' Cyrus decided in favour of the
advice of Cr&#339;sus, and caused a message to be sent
to Tomyris that she should retire; he would advance
beyond the river. She retired as she promised. But
Cyrus gave his son Cambyses, who would be king
after him, to Cr&#339;sus, and exhorted him to honour the
Lydian king, and treat him kindly if the expedition
across the river should turn out badly. Then he sent
the two to Persia, and crossed the river with his army.
And in the first night which he spent in the land of
the Massaget&aelig; he saw in a dream the eldest son of
Hystaspes, with wings on his shoulders, one of which
overshadowed Asia and the other Europe. The eldest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
son of Hystaspes was Darius, at that time a youth of
about 20 years, who had been left behind in Persia,
because he was not old enough to accompany the
army. Cyrus summoned Hystaspes, took him aside,
and said to him in private: 'Hystaspes, thy son is
conceiving evil plots against me and my kingdom.
The gods watch over me, and show me the danger
which is threatening. Return at once to Persia, and
act in such a way that if I succeed in this enterprise
and return home, thou mayest bring thy son before
me for examination.' Hystaspes answered: 'If the
dream shows thee that my son is conceiving a revolt
against thee, I will give him over to thee to deal with
as thou wilt.' Then Hystaspes went over the Araxes
on his way back to Persia, to keep his son under
guard for Cyrus. But when he had gone a day's march
from the river, Cyrus did as Cr&#339;sus had advised; he
left the useless men in the camp, and marched with
the able-bodied back to the river. A third part of
the army of the Massaget&aelig; came to the camp, slew
those that were left behind, in spite of their resistance,
and as they found the meal prepared, and had
conquered the enemy, they feasted, and then fell
asleep, gorged with food and wine. When the Persians
came up they slew many of them, and took even
more prisoners, among them Spargapises, the son of
Tomyris, the leader of the Massaget&aelig;. When the
queen discovered what had befallen the army and her
son, she sent a herald to Cyrus, who said: 'O Cyrus,
insatiate of blood, exalt not thyself because that
by the fruit of the vine, filled with which ye rage and
utter evil words&mdash;that by such poison thou hast
treacherously got possession of my son, and not by
bravery in the battle. Now take my advice, for I
counsel thee well. Give me my son back again, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
depart out of this land, without punishment for bringing
shame on the third part of the army of the Massaget&aelig;.
If thou dost not do this, I swear by the sun,
the lord of the Massaget&aelig;, that I will satisfy thee with
blood, insatiate as thou art.' To this message Cyrus paid
no heed. When he had recovered from the effects of
the wine, Spargapises discovered into what a calamity
he had fallen. He requested Cyrus that he should be
freed from his chains. As soon as this was done, and
his hands were free, he killed himself. As Cyrus did
not obey her, Tomyris collected her whole force, and
joined battle with him. I learn that this battle was
the most severe ever fought among the barbarians,
and it was fought as follows. In the first place, so
we are told, they hurled missiles from a distance,
and when the missiles were exhausted they fell upon
each other, and fought with lances and swords. They
maintained the battle a long time, for neither side
would fly; but at last the Massaget&aelig; got the upper
hand. The greater part of the Persian army perished
and Cyrus himself fell, after a reign of 29 years.
Tomyris searched for the corpse of Cyrus among the
dead, and when she had found it, she plunged the
head in a bottle filled with human blood, and said in
insult to the dead: 'Though I live and have conquered
thee in the battle, thou hast nevertheless made me
unhappy, for thou hast taken away my son by
treachery. Yet, as I threatened, I will satisfy thee
with blood.'"</p>

<p>In a similar way, though not without variations,
Diodorus and Trogus narrate the death of Cyrus. The
account of Diodorus marks even more strongly the
shameful death of the king. He tells us that, after the
overthrow of the Babylonians, Cyrus desired to subdue
the whole earth. He had reduced the greatest nations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and mightiest nations, he was of opinion that no ruler
or nation could withstand his power. Like many of
those who exercise irresponsible power, Cyrus did not
know how to bear prosperity as a man should. He
led a strong army to Scythia; but the queen of the
Scythians took him prisoner and crucified him. In
the excerpt from Pompeius Trogus we are told that
when Cyrus had reduced Asia and brought the East
into his power, he marched upon the Scythians. But
Tomyris, their queen, was not terrified by the approach
of the Persians. She might have defended
the passage of the Jaxartes against them, but she
considered that flight would be more difficult for the
enemy if they had the river behind them. So Cyrus
crossed the Jaxartes, and pitched his camp when he
had advanced some distance into the country of the
enemy. On the next day he abandoned it as if in
terror and retired, leaving in it a sufficiency of wine
and everything that is required for a banquet. The
queen, on hearing this, sent her young son to pursue
the enemy with a third part of her army. When he
reached the camp, the youth, who had no experience
of war, gave up all thought of the enemy, and allowed
his people to become intoxicated with the wine, to
which they were not accustomed. Cyrus returned in
the night, and all the Scythians including the queen's
son were cut down. In spite of the loss of such an
army, and the still greater loss of her only son,
Tomyris thought only of revenge, and plotted how
she could destroy the victors by treachery. When
she was no longer in a condition to give battle
she enticed Cyrus by retiring into a pass, after she
had placed an ambush in the mountains. So she
succeeded in defeating the whole Persian army,
200,000 men, with the king. Not even a messenger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
escaped to tell of the disaster. She caused the
head to be cut off the body of Cyrus, and placed
in a bottle filled with human blood, calling out:
"Satiate thyself with the blood for which thou didst
thirst with an insatiable desire."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> In regard to this
story, which no doubt is to be ascribed to Deinon,
Arrian remarks quite briefly: "Whether the defeat
of the Persians in Scythia was brought about by the
difficulty of the land, or some mistake of Cyrus, or
whether the Scythians were better soldiers than the
Persians of that date, I cannot determine."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Polyaenus
must have had stories of a similar kind before him; but
in his account the stratagem which Cyrus uses against
Tomyris is used by the queen against Cyrus, and
this is the reason given for the defeat of the Persian
army and the death of the king. When Cyrus
approached, Tomyris retreated with her army in pretended
flight. The Persians pursued; in the camp
of the queen they found a great store of wine,
provisions, and cattle, on which they feasted and drank
the whole night through as though they had already
won the battle. Then, when they could scarcely
move, Tomyris attacked them and cut them all down
together with Cyrus himself.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The narrative of Herodotus involves glaring contradictions.
In opposition to the cunning, ambition, and
bloodthirstiness of Cyrus, it presents to us as a model
of honour, love of peace, moderation and self-restraint,
the queen of a nation of cannibals, who gives Cyrus
the wisest lessons before exacting punishment for
his insatiable ambition. She perceives the treachery
of his intended wooing. When he comes openly with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
force, she urges him to be content with what he
possesses, makes the battle easier for him by allowing
him to cross the river without opposition, and then
gives him the choice of a field of battle. When Cyrus
has made a treacherous use of her honourable and
open offers she taunts him with the evil results of
the use of wine on the Persians and again offers peace
on the most favourable conditions; if Cyrus surrenders
her son and retires from her country she will
allow the destruction of her army to go unpunished.
This moderation remains without any effect; Cyrus
goes blindly to his destruction. But the queen of
the barbarians has no enjoyment of this success; her
sorrow for the loss of her son, who puts an end to his
own life in noble shame that he has brought his army
to destruction, and become a captive by excess in
wine, is greater than her joy at the victory. Hardly
less strange is the conduct of Cyrus. The general
who has conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and
the nations of Asia, is uncertain how to carry on the
campaign against the Massaget&aelig;; he takes counsel
with the prince, whom in spite of the bravery of his
people he has defeated most rapidly and decisively:
he allows this prince to tell him that the son of
Cambyses ought not to give way to a woman, and
follows his advice against the unanimous opinion of
the Persians. At the same time he has evil intimations
about the issue of the decision; and sends
the heir to the throne back to Persia. He boasts
that the gods have announced to him all the misfortunes
which threatened him, whereas it is the
elevation of Darius which was shown to him in the
dream, a danger which did not even remotely threaten
him, and not the destruction which was to overtake
him in two days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>It need not be proved that this narrative has come
from a poetical source. The prominent traits, the
long speeches and counter-speeches, the lament of the
mother, the bottle of blood, point beyond all mistake
to poetry. It is clear that Persian poems would not
ascribe to the great founder of their empire, whom
they honoured as a father, the part which Herodotus
represents him as taking against the queen of a barbarous
nation; least of all would they charge Cyrus
with an insatiable thirst for blood, and bring him on
that account to a shameful end. But the Medes, as
they had matched the poems of the Persians on the
birth, youth, and rise of Cyrus with other songs about
his origin, his fortune, and the fall of Astyages composed
from their own point of view, might very well
describe after their own manner the death of the king.
They could not reverse their own subjugation, but
they could have the satisfaction of reprobating the
ambition and bloodthirstiness of their conqueror, who
called out the Median army for ceaseless service;
they could bring the conqueror of Asia to a miserable
end, and represent the subduer of the noblest men
as finding his master in a woman. And if it was
the advice of a conquered and captive king which led
Cyrus to destruction,&mdash;the trait suits the context and
presents an instance of poetical justice. The dream of
Cyrus obviously belongs to another context; it is
merely inserted here in order to show how Cambyses
and Hystaspes escaped the great defeat in the land of
the Massaget&aelig;. At a later time the Medes felt heavily
enough the power of Darius. The Median poems on
the rebellion of Cyrus contained a certain element of
fact in the desertion of Harpagus, and the same may
have been the case in their poems about Tomyris.
Ctesias told us above that Cyrus conquered and took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>prisoner the king of the Sacae, but was afterwards
severely defeated by his wife Sparethra, in which defeat
many captives were taken, and among them the most
distinguished Medes. Strabo also tells us of a battle
which Cyrus lost against the Sacae. Forced to retire,
he had abandoned his camp and all that was in it,
and when the Sacae were enjoying the booty he fell
upon them and cut them down. These events may
underlie the story of Tomyris.</p>

<p>From the various narratives, which, as Herodotus
informs us, were current about the rise and death of
Cyrus, the historian chose that account of both which
seemed to him the "most probable," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> that which
coincided with his own views, and thus appeared to
him most credible. It is the firm conviction of
Herodotus, the thought which lies at the base of his
great history, that every unjust deed, every act of
violence, is followed by punishment. Cyrus had
considered himself to be more than a man; he had
placed no limit, no end to his conquests. Hence
retribution overtook him in his conflict with a woman.
The description of the barbarous custom of the Massaget&aelig;
was obviously wanting in the authority which
Herodotus followed about the death of Cyrus; it
comes from another source. In this way, though
unobserved by Herodotus, a glaring contradiction
has crept into his narrative. If we may draw a
conclusion from the name Spargapises, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> youthful
form, the enemies in the poetry which he used were
of Arian stock.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>According to the account of Ctesias Cyrus fell in
war against the Derbiccians. These were said by
some to dwell in the neighbourhood of the Margiani;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
by others they were placed on both sides of the
mouth of the Oxus; but as Ctesias mentions the
Indians as their allies and represents the Sacae as
dwelling at no great distance, we must look for them
on the middle course of the Oxus in the neighbourhood
of Bactria. According to Strabo's description,
the Derbiccians worshipped the earth, to which they
sacrificed male creatures, just as they ate none but
male animals. The smallest offence was punished
with death. The men who had exceeded their seventieth
year were slain and eaten by their nearest
relatives. The women who came to old age were also
killed but not eaten. Curtius states that a part of
their warriors were armed with poles hardened in
the fire.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> "Amoraeus," so we are told in the excerpt
preserved from Ctesias' "Persian History," "was king
of the Derbiccians; against him Cyrus marched, and
the Indians aided the Derbiccians in the battle. The
elephants which the Derbiccians received from the
Indians were placed in the ambush. They caused the
Persian cavalry to retreat. Cyrus fell from his horse,
and as he lay on the ground an Indian hit him with
his javelin under the hip in the thigh. He was
lifted up and carried into the Persian camp. In
this battle many of the Persians fell, and also many
of the Derbiccians&mdash;10,000 on either side. Hearing
this, Amorges the king of the Sacae came to the
help of Cyrus with 20,000 men. When the battle
was renewed, the Persians and Sacae fought bravely
and conquered. Amoraeus fell and with him his two
sons; 30,000 Derbiccians and 9000 Persians were left
in the field, and the land of the Derbiccians submitted
to Cyrus. But he felt his end approaching. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
named his eldest son Cambyses as his successor;
and the younger Tanyoxarkes he made lord of the
Bactrians, the Chorasmians, Parthians, and Carmanians,
with an arrangement that their lands should pay
no tribute. To the two sons of Spitamas, Spitaces
and Megabernes (V. 383), he gave the satrapies
of the Derbiccians and Hyrcanians (Barcanians),
and bade them obey their mother (Amytis) in all
things. They were also to give their hands to each
other and to Amorges in pledge that they would
treat him and each other as friends; on him who
persisted in kindness to his brother Cyrus invoked
blessings, and curses on him who should be the first
to begin a quarrel. Thus saying, he died on the
third day after his wound."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>This narrative also goes back to a poetical source,
though it is not directly borrowed any more than the
narrative of Herodotus. Meagre as the excerpt is,
there can be no doubt about the poetical origin of it.
This is proved by the compression of the events into
a few days; the rapid and ready assistance given by
the king of the Sacae, whom Cyrus had once captured
in battle and then made his friend; the gratitude
which he reaped for this deed in his last days; the
heavy penalty laid upon the Derbiccians for the
wound of Cyrus; the fall of their king and his two
sons and the submission of the country; the death of
Cyrus after great danger in the moment of victory;
the appointment of a successor; the recommendation
of Amorges; the exhortations to union given by Cyrus
when dying to his sons; his blessing on the son who
remembered them, and his curse on him who neglected
them. Here also, as in the different accounts of
Herodotus and Ctesias in the elevation of Cyrus, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
find points of agreement in the two versions. Whether
the names Tomyris and Amoraeus can be connected we
need not inquire. Each story contains the space of
three days, the appointment of a successor, the exhortations
and the recommendation of a third person&mdash;Cr&#339;sus
in the one, Amorges in the other. As in the
story of Ctesias&mdash;Nicolaus about the rise of Cyrus,
Oebares takes the place of Harpagus in Herodotus, so
here the Sacian Amorges takes the place of the Lydian
Cr&#339;sus; though Cr&#339;sus, it is true, gives only ruinous
advice, and Amorges renders active and valuable help.
As the Persian tradition is preserved in the story of
Ctesias about the rise of Cyrus, though the Medes had
their discrepant version, so in the story of the fall, as
given by this historian, we have no doubt the Persian
account. The region which is allotted to the second
son, the emphasis laid on the harmony of the sons,
the death of Cyrus in victory, no less than the tone
which pervades the whole narrative, prove the Persian
origin of the story. The aged prince is wounded at
the head of his people in a battle on horseback; but
his friends avenge him; he dies, as he had lived, in
victory and success, surrounded by his sons and stepsons.
This glorification of his death was matched
by the Medes in the poems from which the narrative
of Herodotus has arisen.</p>

<p>Xenophon represents Cyrus as dying at an advanced
age in peace, when he has reached Persia for the
seventh time after winning the empire. In the palace
he had a dream which announced his approaching
end. He caused his sons to be brought to him, who
had accompanied him to Persia, his friends, and the
captains of the Persians. His power, so he told them,
had not decayed with age; he had striven for nothing
and attempted nothing that he had not obtained,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and what he had once obtained he had never lost.
Though everything had succeeded according to his
wishes, he had never allowed himself to indulge in
proud thoughts and excessive rejoicing, for he had
ever been attended by the apprehension that evil
would come upon him in the future. "Do you now,
Cambyses," he continued, "receive the throne, which
the gods and I, so far as lies in me, give to you; to
you, Tanaoxares, I give the satrapy over the Medes,
the Armenians, and the Cadusians. I give you this
because I deem it right to leave to the elder the
larger dominion and the name of king, but to you a
less burdensome fortune." Then he urged both to
remain in the closest friendship, for they had been
nourished by one mother, and had grown up in
one house; neither of them could find a stronger support
than his brother. He made them swear by the
gods of their fathers that they would hold each other
in honour; they could not prove their love for him
more truly in any other way. Finally, he reminded
them that by showing kindness to friends they would
be able to punish their enemies, gave his hand to all,
veiled his face and died.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>According to the account of the companions of
Alexander of Macedon, the corpse of Cyrus rested in
the abode of his ancestors, at his metropolis, Pasargadae,
in the precincts of the "old citadel." Concerning
his tomb we have only the account of
Aristobulus, who saw it when Alexander reached
Pasargadae, and on the return from India received
a commission to restore the sepulchres which had
been plundered in the mean time. This account is
preserved in two excerpts; the shorter one is given
by Strabo, the more circumstantial by Arrian. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the latter we are told: "At Pasargadae in the royal
garden (Paradeisus) was the tomb of Cyrus. Round
the tomb a grove of trees had been planted of various
kinds; the soil was permeated by streams and overgrown
with thick grass. The tomb itself was built
of square stones in a rectangular form; the upper
part was a covered chamber." From Strabo we learn
that "the tomb is a tower of no great size, which is
massive in the lower part, but in the upper story is
a room." "The door which leads into it," Arrian
continues, "is so narrow, that a moderately stout man
could scarcely enter. In the chamber was a couch
with feet of beaten gold, with purple coverlet over
which lay carpets of Babylonian pattern. There was
also a robe (<i>kandys</i>) and under-garments of Babylonian
manufacture, and Median trowsers, garments
coloured blue and purple, some of one colour, some
of the other, chains, swords, and necklaces of gold
and precious stones, and a table (Strabo adds goblets).
On the middle of the couch was the coffin with the
corpse of Cyrus, covered with a lid. The inscription
on the grave, in the Persian language and Persian
letters, says: 'O men, I am Cyrus the son of Cambyses,
who founded the empire of the Persians and
governed Asia; do not grudge me this monument.'
Within the outer wall of the sepulchre near the steps
which lead to the chamber was a small dwelling for
the Magians, who have watched the tomb since the
time of Cyrus, the office descending from father to
son. Each day they receive a sheep and a fixed
amount of corn and wheat, and each month a horse
to sacrifice to Cyrus." The corpse itself is said to
have been completely preserved after two centuries.
Onesicritus tells us that the tower of the sepulchre
had ten stories; the inscription was in Persian and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Greek written in Persian letters, and said: "Here
lie I, Cyrus, king of kings."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Near the modern city of Murghab, on a plain
covered with the ruins of walls, not far from a square
tower and a platform, built of square blocks of
marble to a height of nearly forty feet, on a substructure
of seven flats (the sacred number which we
meet everywhere) arranged in terraces, rises a plain
oblong building constructed of huge stones of the
most beautiful white marble, which are closely fitted
together, and covered with a flat gable roof; it forms
a chamber in which the entrance is through a door
four feet in height. The excellent and beautiful proportions,
the quiet simple forms of the building, give
an impression of solemnity, and appear to mark a
consecrated place. Close to this building, and again
in a terrace, we find bases, shafts, and pillars, which
must have belonged to a large structure, perhaps to
a portico, which was in some connection with the
stages of the terrace. Three door-posts bear, in three
different languages, the inscription: "I, Cyrus, the
king, the Ach&aelig;menid." Hence there can be no doubt
that these remains belong to a structure erected by
Cyrus. Before the posts are twelve bases, and before
these a pillar of marble fifteen feet in height, formed
from a single stone. On this is cut in relief a
slim form in profile. It has four wings springing
from the shoulders, is clothed in a closely-fitting
garment falling to the ancles; on the right side which
is visible, and on the lower hem, the garment is furnished
with fringes. The form of the uncovered lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
arm seems to indicate a commanding attitude. The
head is covered with a striped, closely-fitting cap,
which reaches down to the neck. Out of the crown
of it rise two horns, which extend on either side and
bear a tall ornament of peculiarly-formed leaves and
feathers. The face is surrounded by a full but short
beard, the nose is somewhat rounded at the tip, the
line of the profile is straight and well-formed, the
expression mild and serene. Over the head, as on the
posts, we find written in cuneiform letters: "<i>Adam
Kurus Khsayathiya Hakhamanisiya</i>" <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "I, Cyrus,
the king, Ach&aelig;menid."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This is, it would seem,
a picture of the famous king.</p>

<p>So far as we can tell Cyrus was long in coming
to his prime, and did not attain to his full powers
till he had reached the years of manhood. Sprung
from the royal house of the Persians, grandson of
Ach&aelig;menes, he grew up at Pasargadae, and rendered
service as a vassal to his sovereign. While performing
courtly and martial duties at Ecbatana, the extinction
of the male line of the house of Deioces, and the
rival claims which the death of Astyages would
call forth, opened to him the prospect of obtaining
independence for himself and the Persians. When
once more among his own people, the suspicion of
Astyages forces arms into the hands of himself and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
his father. Astyages penetrates into the mountains
of Persia, and Cambyses is slain; only after severe
struggles are the Medes beaten back. Cyrus avails
himself of his success in order to carry war into Media.
About eighty years after Ach&aelig;menes had joined
Phraortes Cyrus marches victoriously into Ecbatana.
He at once aims at a higher object. The dominion of
the Medes must pass over to the Persians. Babylon
and Lydia give him time to subjugate the Parthians
and Hyrcanians, to make war on the Sacae and
Bactrians, to reduce the Cadusians, Armenians, and
Cappadocians. When yet unprepared or engaged in
other conflicts, he is attacked by Cr&#339;sus. A brilliant
campaign carries him far beyond the defensive; he
overthrows the Lydian empire and advances to the
shore of the &AElig;gean. While his generals complete
the reduction of Asia Minor he turns again to the
East; once more Babylon gives him time to establish
and extend his empire in the table-land of Iran.
Secure on the East and West he proceeds to the
decisive struggle with Babylon. In the first campaign
he crosses the Tigris and secures the passage; in the
second he defeats Nabonetus, captures Sepharvaim,
storms Babylon, obtains possession of Borsippa, subjugates
Syria, and the Phenician cities. After the
annihilation of the Babylonian kingdom, Cyrus extends
the borders of his empire still further to the
East. The nations on the right bank of the Indus,
the Chorasmians and the Sogdiani, are reduced, and
the Jaxartes becomes the limit of the kingdom. Thus
by unwearied energy, restless effort, and tough endurance,
Cyrus achieved a career which has no equal;
from being chief of the Persian tribes he became
sovereign of Asia. As Xenophon says, his kingdom
extended from regions which are rendered uninhabit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>able
by heat, to others which are uninhabitable by
reason of the cold. This aim Cyrus had pursued
with great determination; he had not been guilty
of any wild outbursts. A general, rapid in decision
and tenacious in purpose, he had understood how
to meet failure and make himself master of the most
difficult undertakings. Other military princes of the
East have achieved greater conquests in a shorter
space of time than Cyrus, but none understood how
to preserve the empire he had won, and make it
permanent, as Cyrus did. He possessed not only
the keen eye of the general, but an unerring political
insight, and an unusual power of penetrating into
the interests, the motives, the manners and actions
of the communities and nations which victory placed
in his power. Among the rulers of the East no one
is like him, and one alone approaches him, the
second successor on the throne which he founded.</p>

not Cyrus but his Fravashi which is here represented. The building
at Murghab is somewhat like the description of the tomb of Cyrus
given in the text, but the site will not allow us to regard it as the
tomb at Pasargadae. It must be a building which one of his successors
has dedicated to the memory of the great king. The profile in the
relief confirms to some degree Plutarch's statement that Cyrus had an
aquiline nose, and the Persians therefore considered beaked noses
the most becoming: "Praec. ger. reip." c. 30. The nose of Darius, as
we see it in the monuments, appears straighter and longer.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE FALL OF EGYPT.</h3>


<p>After the death of the great king who had founded
the Persian empire, Cambyses (Kambujiya), the elder
of the two sons whom Cassandane had borne to Cyrus,
ascended the throne of the new kingdom in the year
529 <small>B.C.</small> A few years before his death Cyrus had
entrusted him with the vice-royalty of Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Herodotus tells us that "Cambyses again reduced the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
nations which Cyrus had subjugated, and then marched
against Egypt." Egypt was the oldest of the great
powers of the ancient East, and, after the fall of
Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, it still remained independent
beside the kingdom which had risen up
so rapidly and brilliantly out of their ruins. A
hundred and fifty years previously Egypt had succumbed
to the arms of the Assyrians; how could an
ambitious ruler of Persia imagine that it could now
resist the incomparably greater forces which were at
his command?</p>

<p>We know how Psammetichus and his descendants
had restored Egypt to her ancient position, the place
which they had assigned to the Greeks and Greek
civilisation in their state, a place which had not been
altered by Amasis, though brought to the throne by
a revolution which had removed the house of Psammetichus
(570 <small>B.C.</small>). The attempt of Necho to renew
the achievements of the Tuthmosis, Amenophis, and
Ramses in Syria and on the Euphrates was wrecked
by the sudden rise of the Babylonian kingdom under
Nebuchadnezzar, and Hophra had in vain attempted
to prevent the fall of Jerusalem and the advance of
Babylon to the borders of Egypt. The growth of the
Persian power threatened to give Egypt a far more
dangerous neighbour than she had had in Babylonia.
Amasis did not underrate the crisis. Herodotus told
us above that he had combined with Lydia against
Cyrus, that Cr&#339;sus had called upon the Egyptian
auxiliaries for the second campaign, and finally for the
rescue of Sardis. The rapid progress of the war
and the fall of Sardis defeated the aims of Amasis.
Then, as we saw, a decade elapsed before Cyrus
directed his arms against Babylonia. That Amasis
made every attempt to support Nabonetus against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the Persians is not told us by tradition, unless
indeed we accept as tradition Xenophon's statement,
who represents the Lydians and Egyptians as fighting
against the Persians with the Babylonians (p. 17).
The fall of Babylon was followed directly by the
subjugation of Syria, the conquest of Gaza (p. 90),
and the advance of the Persian border to the desert.
Amasis does not appear to have been wholly inactive
in the face of the approaching danger. Herodotus
tells us that he took the island of Cyprus and made
it tributary, and Diodorus narrates that he subjugated
the cities in Cyprus, and adorned many of the temples
there with splendid offerings.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> We may assume that
the enterprise of Amasis against Cyprus was intended
to provide a counterpoise to the incorporation of Syria
in the Persian empire. It may have appeared more
desirable to the princes of the Cyprian cities to be
vassals of the remote and less powerful Egypt than of
the rising and powerful kingdom of Persia. In any
case, when he had set foot in Cyprus, Amasis prevented
that rich island, with its numerous cities, from
falling into the power of the Persians; the ships of
the Cyprian cities could assist him in keeping off
the fleet of the Phenicians from their coasts, should
the Persian monarch call out that fleet against Egypt.
That this was the object of the occupation of Cyprus
by Amasis is confirmed by the fact that some years
after the fall of Babylon he entered into communication
with the island of Samos. While Chios and
Lesbos, as has been observed, submitted to the Persians
without compulsion, Samos had remained independent.
Polycrates, the son of Aeaces, who had made
himself master of the island in the year 536 <small>B.C.</small>, built
a splendid fleet of eighty heavy and a hundred light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
ships, with which he could maintain his independence
against the Persians. The fleet of Polycrates
could hold the fleet of the Ionians in check if it were
called upon by the Persians, just as the Cyprians could
restrain the Phenicians. Amasis entered into close
and friendly relations with the prince of Samos, who
on his part must have gladly accepted the support of
Egypt against the Persians. Besides the possession
of Cyprus and this union with Samos, Egypt's power
of resistance rested essentially on the difficulty of
crossing the desert which separates Egypt from Syria
with a large army, on the considerable numbers of the
warrior caste, in spite of the emigration under Psammetichus,
and the fidelity and bravery of the Ionian
and Carian mercenaries, to whom Amasis had entrusted
his personal protection. The danger of an attack from
Persia seemed to have passed over when, after the
subjugation of Syria, Cyrus turned towards the distant
East, the Indus and Jaxartes; and Amasis may have
been careful not to irritate his powerful neighbour.
The skill of the physicians of Egypt was in great
repute. When Cyrus asked Amasis for the best
oculist, the Pharaoh, according to the Persian story,
may have acceded to his wish.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The death of Cyrus
would then bring still greater prospects of power to
Amasis, until at last the decisive moment came
thirteen years after the fall of Babylon.</p>

<p>"Cambyses," so Herodotus tells us, "sent to Egypt
and asked the daughter of Amasis in marriage. Both
hating and dreading the power of the Persians,
Amasis was uncertain whether to send or refuse her,
for he well knew that Cambyses did not intend to take
her as his legitimate wife, but as a concubine. So
he devised the following plan:&mdash;Nitetis, the daughter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
of the preceding king Hophra was the only member
of her family remaining. She was tall and beautiful,
and Amasis adorned her with garments and gold
and sent her as his own daughter to Persia. But
some time after, when Cambyses was embracing
Nitetis and calling her by the name of her father,
she said: 'O king, thou art deceived by Amasis, who
has sent me to thee thus adorned as his daughter,
whereas in truth I am the daughter of Hophra,
whom, though his lord, Amasis slew together with
the Egyptians.' This speech put Cambyses into a
violent rage, and for this reason he marched against
Egypt. This is the account which the Persians give;
but the Egyptians claim Cambyses as their own,
maintaining that he was the son of this daughter
of Hophra. It was not Cambyses, but Cyrus, who
desired the daughter of Hophra. But in this they
are wrong. The law of the Persians is not unknown
to them (for the Egyptians know the laws of the
Persians better than any one else), that the son of
the concubine is not made king if there are sons
of the queen, and that Cambyses was the son of
Cassandane, the daughter of Pharnaspes, and not of
the Egyptian woman. They invert the transaction
because they wish to give themselves out as allied
to the house of Amasis. Among the auxiliary troops
of Amasis there was a man of Halicarnassus, Phanes
by name, of good understanding and mighty in war.
Injured by Amasis in some way, he fled by ship out
of Egypt, in order to join Cambyses. As he was
a man of importance among the auxiliary troops,
and most accurately acquainted with Egypt, Amasis
was anxious to take him, and sent his most trusty
eunuch after him in a trireme. The eunuch caught
him up in Lycia, but he did not bring him back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Egypt. Phanes outwitted him, by making his guards
intoxicated, and so escaped to Persia. When he
came to Cambyses, who, though intending to invade
Egypt, was uncertain how to pass through the
waterless region, Phanes told him all the affairs of
Amasis, and how the march was to be arranged.
He advised him to send to the king of the Arabians,
and ask him to give him a safe passage. The approach
to Egypt is open on this side only. From
Ph&#339;nicia to the borders of the city of Gaza,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> which,
as it seems to me, is not much smaller than Sardis,
the land belongs to the Syrians, who are called Palaestinians
(Pelishtim), but from this city to Jenysus
the harbours of the sea are subject to the Arabians;
from Jenysus to the Serbonian Lake they again belong
to the Syrians, and at the Serbonian Lake Egypt
begins. The strip between the city of Jenysus and
the Serbonian Lake, a journey of three days, is wholly
without water. Instructed by the Halicarnassian,
Cambyses sent messengers to the Arabian, and received
permission for the passage, and when the
Arabian had given the envoy of Cambyses a solemn
promise with invocation of Urotal and Alilat, and
smearing of seven stones with blood (I. 308), he
caused bags of camel-skins to be filled with water,
loaded all his camels with them, and after marching
into the waterless district he there awaited the
army of Cambyses. But Psammenitus, the son of
Amasis, encamped on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile.
For when Cambyses marched with all over whom
he ruled, even with those of the Hellenes who were
in his power,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> against Egypt, he found that Amasis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
was no longer alive; he had died after a reign of 44
years, without meeting with any great disaster in
that time. When the Persians had marched through
the waterless region and had pitched their camp
opposite the Egyptians for battle, the auxiliaries
of the Egyptians, Hellenes and Carians, who were
enraged against Phanes because he had brought a
foreign army against Egypt, did as follows:&mdash;The
children of Phanes had remained in Egypt. They
brought them into the camp, and then led them between
the two camps before the eyes of their father,
and slew them one after the other over a vessel.
When they were all dead they poured water and
wine into the vessel; all the mercenaries drank of
the blood and then went to battle. The struggle
was severe; when a great number had fallen on
both sides the Egyptians were put to flight. And
here I observed a very strange phenomenon, my
attention being called to it by the natives. The
bones of those who fell in the battle were gathered
up separately; the Persians are on one side and on
the other the Egyptians, and the sculls of the
Persians are so thin, that even if a pebble is thrown
upon them they break, while those of the Egyptians
are so hard that they can hardly be broken with a
stone. The Egyptians fled without any order. To
those who were shut up in Memphis Cambyses sent
a Persian herald in a trireme, to summon them to
surrender. But when the Egyptians saw the ship
come into Memphis they hastened down from the
citadel, destroyed the ship, tore the men in pieces,
and carried them to the citadel. Then the Egyptians
were besieged and finally surrendered."</p>

<p>"On the tenth day after Cambyses had taken
the citadel of Memphis he desired to make trial of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Psammenitus, whom he had taken prisoner with the
other Egyptians in the city, and who had reigned but
six months. He therefore did as follows: He sent his
daughter in the dress of a slave with a pitcher, and
along with her the daughters of the leading Egyptians,
similarly attired, to fetch water. When they passed
before their fathers with lamentations and sighs,
these also cried and sighed at the sight of their
daughters' shame, but when Psammenitus saw what
was done he fixed his eyes on the earth. When the
maidens had passed with the water, Cambyses caused
the son of Psammenitus to be led past with two
thousand Egyptians of the same age, with ropes
round their necks and in their mouths. They were
to be the expiation of the Mytileneans, who were
slain on the ship in Memphis; the royal judges of the
Persians (p. 105) had decided that for every dead
man ten of the leading Egyptians must die. Psammenitus
saw the train, and knew that his son was being
led out to death, and the Egyptians who sat round
him wailed and lamented, but he did as he had done at
the sight of his daughter. When they also had passed,
it happened that an old man, who had been a guest
at the table of the king, but had now lost everything
and was as poor as a beggar, and asked alms of the
soldiers, passed by Psammenitus and the Egyptians in
the suburbs. When Psammenitus saw this he lamented
aloud, beat his head, and called on his friend by name.
The guards who stood by announced what he had
done on each occasion.  Cambyses was astonished,
and asked Psammenitus, by a messenger, why he
had neither lamented nor sighed at the sight of his
daughter in her shame, and his son when led out
to execution, but had paid this tribute of respect to
a beggar with whom Cambyses had discovered he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
was in no way connected. Psammenitus answered,
'O son of Cyrus, my own misfortune was too great
for tears, but the sorrows of my friend called for
lamentation, since on the threshold of old age he
had fallen from great possessions to the condition of
a beggar.' When this was told to Cambyses it seemed
to him well said; but as the Egyptians tell the story,
Cr&#339;sus wept (he had followed Cambyses to Egypt),
and the Persians who were present wept, and Cambyses
was touched with some degree of compassion.
He at once gave orders not to execute the son of
Psammenitus, and to fetch Psammenitus from the
suburb into his presence. The messengers found the
son no longer alive, but they brought Psammenitus
himself to Cambyses, who did him no further injury.
Had Psammenitus known how to remain quiet, he
would certainly have received the government of
Egypt; for the Persians are wont to honour the sons
of kings, and even though the fathers have revolted,
they give the dominion to the son. But when
Psammenitus dealt treacherously he received his
reward. He was detected in exciting the Egyptians
to revolt. When Cambyses discovered this, he compelled
him to drink bulls' blood, and he died on
the spot. Such was his end."</p>

<p>"But Cambyses came from Memphis to Sais, and
when he entered the palace of Amasis, he gave orders
to take his body out of the grave; when this was
done he caused the corpse to be scourged, the hair to
be torn out; he stabbed it and treated it with every
kind of indignity. When those who were executing
his commands grew weary, for the body being embalmed
resisted their blows, and did not come to
pieces, he ordered it to be burned. This was a
sacrilegious command. The Persians regard fire as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
deity, and the burning of the dead is not according
to the laws either of the Persians or the Egyptians.
The Persians do not consider it right to offer a corpse
to a god; the Egyptians regard fire as a living all-consuming
animal, and as it is by no means lawful
to give up corpses to animals, they embalm them
that they may not be consumed by worms. Hence
Cambyses had commanded what was not allowed
by the law of either nation. But the Egyptians say
that it was not Amasis who endured this contumely,
but another Egyptian of the same age, whom the
Persians outraged under the impression that they
were outraging Amasis. Amasis had been informed
by an oracle what would happen to him after death;
to escape his fate he had buried a man, who died at
the time, in the tomb which he had made for himself
at the temple of Neith at Sais, near the door, and
had commanded his son to bury him in the innermost
grave-chamber. In my opinion these arrangements
of Amasis about his burial were not carried out, they
were mere inventions of the Egyptians."</p>

<p>Ctesias' narrative is as follows: Cambyses fulfilled
the last commands of his father that his younger
brother Tanyoxarkes should be made lord of the
Bactrians, Chorasmians, Parthians, and Carmanians,
and in every other respect, and sent his corpse
to Persia for burial. Having ascertained that the
Egyptian women were more desirable than others, he
asked Amasis for one of his daughters, and Amasis
sent Nitetis the daughter of Hophra. Cambyses took
great delight in her, and loved her much, and when
he had learned all her story he acceded to her request
that he would avenge the murder of her father.
When he had armed against Egypt and Amyrtaeus,
the Egyptian king, the eunuch Combaphes, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
great influence with Amyrtaeus, betrayed the passes
into Egypt, and all the affairs of the country, in order
that he might be viceroy of it. Then Cambyses set
out on his march; in the battle 50,000 Egyptians
and 20,000 Persians were slain,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Amyrtaeus was taken
alive, and all Egypt was subjugated. Cambyses did
no further harm to Amyrtaeus beyond sending him
with 6000 Egyptians of his own choice to Susa; but
Combaphes became governor of Egypt as Cambyses
had promised first by Izabates, his most trusted
eunuch and the cousin of Combaphes, and then by
his own mouth.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus' account is once more dominated by the
desire to give prominence to the vengeance for the
crime which Amasis committed in betraying Hophra
his master and thrusting from the throne the legitimate
ruler of Egypt (III. 407). Amasis was spared,
but the punishment fell upon the son, who thus
suffered for his father's sins. The sources open to
Herodotus were the narratives of the Persians, of the
Egyptians, and of his own people. The Greeks of
Asia Minor had taken part in the campaign of Cambyses
against Egypt; Greek mercenaries assisted in
the defence; and as we have seen, Greeks were settled
in Egypt in considerable numbers. Herodotus himself
rejects the story that Cambyses was the son of
the daughter of Hophra, as the Egyptians maintained
by way of consolation; as well as another story that
Cambyses had invaded Egypt in order to avenge the
preference which Cyrus showed to the daughter of
Hophra over his mother Cassandane. On the other
hand, he adopts, though with hesitation, the story of
the Persians that Cambyses sought a wife from Amasis,
because it agrees with his own idea that ruin was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
brought upon Amasis by his own treachery and the
daughter of the Pharaoh whom he had deposed.
Deinon in his Persian History and Lyceas of Naucratis
retained both these stories together in the form that
Amasis sent Nitetis to Cyrus, and that she was the
mother of Cambyses who invaded Egypt to avenge
Hophra. The solicitation of Cambyses, and the
deception of Amasis, in Herodotus, and in a still
more pointed form in Ctesias, the source of which,
Herodotus tells us, was the narrative of the Persians,
has obviously arisen out of Persian poems
about Cambyses, which required some poetical motive
for the campaign against Egypt; we saw that the
modern version of the poems concerning Cyrus represented
the campaign against Tomyris as due to a
similar motive. Hophra died in the year 570; when
Cambyses ascended the throne, his youngest daughter
must have been more than forty years of age. There
was no need of any motive of this kind to excite
Cambyses against Egypt, as has been shown above;
after the fall of Lydia and Babylonia, Egypt was the
natural aim for the Persian weapons.</p>

<p>Cambyses did not begin the war against Egypt
immediately after his accession. Though Ctesias
tells us that he first placed his brother over the
Bactrians, Chorasmians, Parthians, and Carmanians,
Cyrus, when he entrusted the kingdom of Babylonia
to Cambyses, may have given the viceroyalty over
the regions of the East to his younger son. We
may confidently believe Herodotus that the death
of Cyrus gave the subject nations the hope of again
throwing off the yoke. After overcoming these rebellions
(p. 131), in the fifth year of his reign,
Cambyses marched against Egypt. Amasis, as we
have observed, had made himself master of the island<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of Cyprus, and had entered into communication with
Polycrates the prince of Samos, in order to cover
an attack on Egypt by sea, and provide, in case of
necessity, a counterpoise to the naval power of the
Greek cities on the coast, and that of the Phenicians.
Cyrus had allowed his empire to be bounded by
the sea, though he did not refuse the voluntary
submission of Chios and Lesbos. Cambyses went
further. He wished to procure a fleet for his kingdom;
Persia was to rule by sea as well as land.
This, it is true, could only be done by forcing arms
into the hands of subject tribes and cities, and that
on an element on which the Persians could not pursue
them. It was a bold conception, and in forming
it Cambyses must have felt quite secure of the
obedience of the Greek and Phenician cities, and
of the allegiance of the old princely houses who
ruled in the latter no less than of the new ones
who ruled in the former. For the first time the
command went forth to the harbour cities of the
Syrian and Anatolian coasts, that they were to arm
their ships for the king. The fleet was to support
the attack of the land army, and then, passing up
the Nile, facilitate the movements of the army in
Egypt. The ships of the Greeks were to unite
with those of the Phenicians in the harbour of Acco
to the south of Carmel.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> This resolution of Cambyses
and the assembling of so magnificent a fleet on
the coast of Ph&#339;nicia at once bore fruit. The princes
of the Cyprian cities abandoned Egypt, recognised
the supremacy of Persia, and at once prepared their
ships for a voyage against Egypt. In return for
this sudden and voluntary submission they were
allowed to remain at the head of the cities; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
were only to pay tribute and furnish contingents
in war.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> On Polycrates of Samos also the naval
armament of Cambyses made a most lively impression.
When in possession of a strong fleet Cambyses could
use it against Samos. Was Polycrates to fight for
Egypt whose naval power could not defend him against
this fleet, or was he to remain neutral? Polycrates
held the latter course to be the worst; neutrality
during the war of Cyrus and Cr&#339;sus had cost the
Greek cities dear enough. He determined to change
his front. When the Ionian cities launched their
ships, and the vessels of Chios and Lesbos steered
towards the Syrian coast, he also offered to place ships
at the disposal of the Persian king for use in Egypt.
Cambyses accepted the submission of Polycrates, and
he sent forty well-manned ships of war.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Thus Cambyses had already deprived the Pharaoh
of two important points of support before he had
begun the war. Whether Amasis was alive at the
defection of the princes of Cyprus, and of Polycrates,
is doubtful. It is possible that his death, which
elevated to the throne of Egypt his son Psammenitus
(Psamtek III.), an untried prince in the place of a
proved and experienced leader such as Amasis, was
another weight in the scale on the side of defection.
There was still another difficulty to remove. The
Syrian coast formed a strong wall of protection for
Egypt. If the fleet followed the army along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
coast it found none but difficult landing-places; at
present there are none in that region for the heavier
ships of our days. In any case, in a numerous army
such as Cambyses no doubt led, care would have to
be taken for the horses and camels. It is not true
that Cambyses requested a free passage from the king
of the Arabians; the men in question were the chiefs
of the Arabs in the peninsula of Sinai, the Midianites
and Amalekites; and it was the supply of water for
the army which these tribes undertook. After completing
his preparations Cambyses set out early in
the year 525 <small>B.C.</small>, in order to march through the desert
before the beginning of the hottest weather, and arrive
in Egypt sufficiently early before the inundation.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>As the desertion of Eurybatus aided Cyrus in the
Lydian war (p. 20), so was Cambyses assisted in his
preparations for the campaign against Egypt according
to the narrative of Herodotus by the advice of
Phanes, and according to Ctesias by the advice of
Combaphes. We may here give unhesitating confidence
to the definite assertion of Herodotus as it
concerns his own countryman of Halicarnassus. The
departure of Phanes for Egypt must have taken place
in the autumn of the year 526 <small>B.C.</small>, for it is Amasis
who sends his trusted eunuch after him as far as
Lycia. For the name of Psammenitus the fragment
of Ctesias gives the incorrect name of Amyrtaeus (if
this name of the later opponent of Persia on the Nile
is not due to the excerpt), it substitutes Combaphes
for Phanes, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to all appearances the eunuch who
pursues Phanes for Phanes himself. We do not find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
elsewhere the slightest trace that Combaphes received
the vice-royalty of Egypt; on the contrary, the statements
of the fragments about the cousinship of the
chief eunuch of Pharaoh and the chief eunuch of
Cambyses, and the repeated promise of the vice-royalty
which is made to Combaphes, point to Persian poems,
which had to clothe incidents of this nature in a
poetical garb; we have already frequently met with
the analogous promises of Arbaces to Belesys, and
of Cyrus to the interpreters of dreams at Babylon.</p>

<p>With regard to the course of the war we can only
establish the fact, that Psammenitus collected all his
forces, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the warrior caste, and his Ionian and
Carian troops, which were apparently strengthened by
Libyan tribes, and Greeks from Cyrene, and awaited
the attack of the Persians at the point where at
the present day the caravan road from Gaza reaches
Egypt, near Pelusium, the old border fortress, surrounded
by the sand of the desert and wide expanses
of mud. In regard to this battle we only learn from
Ctesias that 50,000 Egyptians and 20,000 Persians
fell; whether it be that these numbers are taken
from the Persian poems, or whether they belong to
the official Persian account. A part of the Egyptian
army retired to Pelusium; with another band of
fugitives Psammenitus reached Memphis. When the
Persians had besieged and captured Pelusium, which
made a bold resistance, Egypt lay open to them.
Cambyses shaped his course to Memphis. There in
past days the empire of the Pharaohs had arisen;
there stood the temple of Ptah, the most sacred shrine
of the land, which Menes himself was said to have
founded, which all his successors, including Amasis, had
enlarged and adorned. Memphis closed the approach
to the upper river valley, which was barred to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Persians so long as the city held out. Hence it appears
to have been the determination of Psammenitus
to give up the delta to the Persians, to defend
Memphis, and shut himself up in its walls. The city
is said to have been twenty miles in circuit (I. 85);
it lay on the western bank of the Nile, and Cambyses
had the difficult task of crossing the river before he
could invest the city. But now it was seen how
great was the support afforded by the fleet. The
Egyptian ships must have been forced to retire; the
union of the Persian army with the fleet was accomplished;
one of these ships appeared before the walls
of Memphis sooner than the army. According to the
account of Herodotus it would seem that it was not
the city but only the citadel of Memphis, "the white
tower" on the southern dam, which defended itself.
If this was the case Cambyses had no doubt to thank
the fleet for it. Elsewhere the city must have been
defended on the side towards the Nile by the river-dams
merely, which the garrison despaired of holding
against the attack of numerous ships of war. Thus
invested and attacked the citadel must at length have
opened the gates; and with the citadel Psammenitus
fell into the hands of the Persians.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> After the fall
of Memphis Cambyses does not seem to have found
resistance anywhere. It is nevertheless possible that
Sais, the residence of Psammetichus and his descendants,
as well as of Amasis and Psammenitus, the
burial-place of the princes and of Amasis, attempted
a defence. In any case the conquest of Sais completed
the subjugation of the Egyptian land. An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
inscription of the Egyptians says: "When the great
prince, the lord of the world, Kambathet, marched
against Egypt, all nations of the earth were with
him. He became lord of the whole land and settled
there."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In a war of a few months Cambyses had
overthrown a kingdom which reckoned by millenniums,
and had been the wonder of the world.</p>

<p>What Herodotus tells us of the fate of Psammenitus
and the death of his son reminds us in a
striking manner of the legend of the Greeks about
the distress and the rescue of Cr&#339;sus, who also
reappears in this narrative. In both Herodotus becomes
uncertain towards the end, and changes from
direct to indirect narration, from assertion to supposition.
When Cyrus commanded Cr&#339;sus to be
burned, he intended, according to Herodotus, to prove
whether a god would come to his aid; Cambyses
intends to put the endurance of Psammenitus to the
test. Two trials are made with this object; and
a third trial also takes place; and if Cr&#339;sus calls
on Solon three times on the pyre, Psammenitus
remains dumb "with horror," as Aristotle says, at
the sight of his daughter at her slavish task, and
of his son when led out to execution; it is only at
the sight of his friend who has become a beggar
that he breaks forth into lamentation. Like Cyrus
at Sardis, Cambyses at Memphis inquires into the
reason of such conduct. But if Cyrus weeps at the
pyre, and desires to save Cr&#339;sus, who is finally
rescued by a god, so in this place, all the Persians
who are present weep, and Cr&#339;sus weeps, and
Cambyses himself is touched by compassion; he
wishes to save the son of Psammenitus; and though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
he cannot do this he releases the father out of
captivity and receives him at his court. There is a
difference in the stories in the fact that though
Cambyses is putting Psammenitus to the test, the
son is actually executed, and that the compassion
of Cambyses is not aroused by the danger impending
over the Egyptian king, but by his conduct. As in
the story of Cr&#339;sus and Cyrus, so in this, we have
obviously a legend of the Greeks&mdash;the Greeks in
Egypt. The first story has arisen out of the intention
of Cr&#339;sus not to survive the fall of his kingdom, to
offer himself as a sacrifice to the angry god of the
Lydians; and the second has no other foundation
than the punishment exacted by Cambyses in accordance
with the sentence of the seven judges (p. 105),
for the murder of his herald who had demanded
the surrender of Memphis, and for the massacre of
the crew of the ship in which the herald had gone
to the city. If the seven judges demand ten
Egyptians for every man slain, this sentence, though
it fell on the most distinguished families of Egypt,
would seem mild enough according to the scale of
oriental punishments; as 2000 men were brought
out for execution, the ship must have had the usual
crew of a Greek trireme. Whether the son of Psammenitus
was really put to death for the herald, we must
leave to the legend; Ctesias tells us only of the deportation
of Psammenitus and 6000 Egyptians to Susa.</p>

<p>Cambyses resolved to treat Psammenitus and
Egypt in precisely the same way as Cyrus had treated
Cr&#339;sus and Lydia, Nabonetus and Babylon. It is
not said that any harm was done to the city of
Memphis, and Herodotus tells us himself that if
Psammenitus had known how to keep quiet, Cambyses
would have entrusted him with the governorship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of Egypt. Yet the degradation of his daughter and
the execution of his son were a strange initiation
of such treatment.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Still more incredible is the ill-treatment
and burning of the corpse of Amasis, for
which Cambyses had not the slightest reason,
especially as Herodotus states that Cambyses sent
Ladice, the widow of Amasis, unharmed back to her
own city of Cyrene.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The story belongs to the
context of the narrative according to which Cambyses
sues for the daughter of Amasis, and is deceived
by him with the daughter of Hophra, whose desire
for vengeance on Amasis he satisfies. As Amasis is
no longer alive, vengeance comes upon his son and
grandson, and even on his own body. For this reason
Herodotus has adopted this story, for he lays great
stress on the fact that no misfortune befell Amasis
in his life, though he rejects the Egyptian version
that Amasis had taken the precaution to substitute
the corpse of another person of the same age for
his own. If Sais resisted and was taken by storm,
the temple of Neith might certainly be injured, the
royal sepulchres violated, and the mummies taken
from them, without any blame attaching to Cambyses,
though on a similar occasion at Memphis he is
charged by Herodotus with opening the tombs and
disturbing the rest of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The Egyptian
inscription informs us that the conduct of Cambyses
at Sais and in the temple of Neith, in the portico
of which Amasis had built his sepulchre, was widely
different from that described by the legend. He
removed his soldiers from the temple, purified it,
and both here and in other places he showed his
regard for the worship of the Egyptians as Cyrus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
had shown it for the worship of the Babylonians
and the Hebrews. From the account of Herodotus,
no less than from the later circumstances of Egypt,
it is clear that no alteration was made in the government,
law, and administration of justice, except that a
Persian satrap was placed at the head of the country
and Persian garrisons were sent to the citadels of
the most important places. Even the Egyptian
warrior caste remained unchanged and undiminished;
it merely passed from the service of the Pharaohs
into that of the Ach&aelig;menids; and after repeated
rebellions numbered more than 400,000 men in the
middle of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small></p>

inclusive of "Kuras, king of Babylon," which entirely agree with the
dates of the canon of Ptolemy, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> with the capture of Babylon by
Cyrus 538 <small>B.C.</small>, and the death of Cyrus in 529 <small>B.C.</small> On another tablet,
No. 877, Br. Mus., we find the "year eleven of Cambyses king of
Babylon" (E. Schrader, "Z. Aegypt. Sprach." 1878, s. 40 ff.). It is a
fact established by the canon of Ptolemy as well as by Herodotus that
Cambyses did not sit on the throne for eight whole years. Tablet 906
explains this eleventh year; it runs as follows: "Babylon month
Kislev, day 25, year 1 of Cambyses king of Babylon, at that time Cyrus
king of the lands." Hence in Babylon dates were sometimes fixed by
the years of Cyrus king of Babylon, and sometimes by the years of
the viceroy. If the "year eleven" of Cambyses in Babylon was the
year of Cambyses' death, Cyrus must have handed over the government
of Babylonia to him in the year 532 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> three years before
his own death. This view, which has been developed by E. Schrader,
I feel able to adopt against the opinion of T. G. Pinches, who wrongly
assumes an abdication of Cyrus. That years were not dated from
Cambyses after his death is proved by seventeen other tablets, which
do not go beyond the eighth year of his reign, and two others of the
20 Elul and 1 Tisri from the first year of Barziya, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the
Pseudo-Smerdis.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE MARCH TO MEROE.</h3>


<p>More than two centuries before Cambyses set foot
upon its soil, Egypt had experienced the rule of the
stranger. The reign of the Ethiopic monarchs of
Napata over Egypt (730-672 <small>B.C.</small>) was followed by
the more severe dominion of the Assyrians. But
Psammetichus had been able to restore the kingdom,
and the sovereignty of his house; the reign of Amasis
had called into existence a beautiful after-bloom of
Egyptian art, had given a lively impulse to trade, and
increased the welfare of the land. Now the day of
Pelusium and the fall of Memphis had decided the
fate of Egypt irrevocably and for all time. The kingdom
had been founded from Memphis three thousand
years previously, and at Memphis it was now overthrown.
Egypt, in spite of repeated and stubborn
attempts, was never able to recover from the dominion
of the Persians, and even the fall of the Persian empire
did not permit the rise of the Egypt of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The speedy and great success which Cambyses
achieved had effects beyond the borders of Egypt.
Herodotus narrates that the Libyans in their anxiety
about the fortune of Egypt submitted to Cambyses
without a battle, promised to pay tribute, and sent
presents. The Cyrenaeans also and Barcaeans from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
similar apprehensions had done the same. The
presents of the Libyans were graciously accepted by
Cambyses, but the 500 minae which the Cyrenaeans
sent, he threw with his own hand among the people
because "it was too little."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Diodorus explains the
anxiety of the Libyans and Cyrenaeans, "after Cambyses
had become lord of the whole of Egypt" and
the voluntary submission which was the consequence
of it, by the fact that the Libyans and Cyrenaeans had
fought against Cambyses with the Egyptians. We
know from other sources that the princes of Cyrene
were in close and friendly connection with Amasis.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
The subjugation of the Libyans cannot have extended
farther than to the tribes adjacent to the Delta, and
reaching towards the west perhaps as far as Cyrene.
At that time Archelaus III. was the king of Cyrene.
More than a century before, Greeks from the island of
Thera had founded the city on the well-watered and
grassy slopes which run from the table-land of Barca
to the sea. Ever since that time the family of
Battus and Archelaus had reigned over this settlement,
which, owing to its favoured position and lively trade,
rose quickly to power and wealth. The attack which
Pharaoh-Hophra made upon it in the year 571 <small>B.C.</small>
had been successfully repulsed by the Cyrenaeans
(III. 405). Subsequently, about the year 545 <small>B.C.</small>,
Battus III. had been compelled to submit to a constitutional
form of government which restricted the
monarchy to a hereditary presidentship. Discontented
with this position, Archelaus III. attempted to recover
the old powers. The attempt failed, Archelaus fled,
and found shelter with Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos.
When he had collected there an army of adventurers
he returned at their head, subverted the constitution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and set on foot a cruel persecution against all who
had adhered to it. He may have felt the ground
insecure under his feet in the city; the fall of
Egypt deprived him of the support which he had had
in that country, and if he had really sent a contingent
to aid Psammenitus he had to fear the vengeance of
Cambyses. These were reasons enough for seeking
the protection of the Persian king. He recognised
the sovereignty of Cambyses, and sent that sum of
money as the first proof of his submission.</p>

<p>"Cambyses now proposed to himself a threefold
expedition," so Herodotus relates; "one against the
Carthaginians, a second against the Ammonians, and
a third against the long-lived Ethiopians, who inhabit
Libya on the southern sea. It seemed best to send
the fleet against the Carthaginians, and a part of the
land army against the Ammonians, but to the Ethiopians
envoys were first sent. When he had given this
command he ordered fish-eaters to be brought from
Elephantine (the island on the Nile on the border
of Egypt) who were acquainted with the language
of the Ethiopians. While these were being brought
he ordered the fleet to set out against Carthage.
But the Phenicians refused; they were bound by
great oaths, and they would be guilty of a crime if
they went against their own children. As the Phenicians
refused, the rest (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Greeks) were not
strong enough, and so the Carthaginians escaped
slavery under the Persians. For Cambyses could not
do violence to the Phenicians, because they had
voluntarily submitted to the Persians (p. 90), and the
whole naval power rested on the Phenicians. When
the fish-eaters had come, they were told what they
had to say to the Ethiopians, and received the presents
which they had to take&mdash;a purple robe, a golden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
necklace and bracelets, a box of alabaster filled with
ointment, and a jar of palm-wine. The Ethiopians to
whom they were sent were said to be the tallest and
most beautiful of men, and as they live under laws
which are different from those of other men, they
were said to regard the man who is the tallest and
strongest among them as the most worthy of the
throne."</p>

<p>"When the fish-eaters reached the Ethiopians and
gave over their presents to the king, they said:
'Cambyses, the king of the Persians, wishes to be your
friend and sends you as presents these things in
which he takes most delight himself.' The Ethiopians
answered: 'The Persian king has not sent you with
these presents because he wishes to be my friend, and
ye are not speaking the truth. You have been sent
to spy out my kingdom, and he is not a righteous
man. If he were righteous he would not have desired
another land than his own, nor would he have reduced
men to slavery from whom he had suffered no
wrong. Give him this bow (the bows of the Ethiopians
were of palm-wood and more than four cubits
in length),<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and say to the king of the Persians, that
when his people can string a bow of that size he may
march against the long-lived Ethiopians with an overwhelming
army; till then, he may thank the gods
that it has not occurred to the sons of the Ethiopians
to conquer another land in addition to their own.'
Then he gave them the bow, and he took the purple
robe, and asked what it was and how it was made.
And when the fish-eaters gave him a true account
of the purple and the dyeing, he said that the men
were deceivers and their garments deceptive. When
he saw the necklace and bracelets, the king laughed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
for he imagined that they were fetters; their fetters,
he said, were stronger. Then he inquired about the
ointment, and when the preparation and use of this
were explained, he said the same as about the robes.
The wine he drank and it pleased him greatly, and
he asked what the king of Persia ate, and what was
the greatest age to which the Persians lived. They
replied that he ate bread, and explained the nature
of wheat; they also put the greatest age to which the
Persians lived at eighty years. The king replied that
he did not wonder that their years were few, inasmuch
as they ate dirt, and they would not live so
long as they did, if the drink did not strengthen
them&mdash;in that matter the Persians had the advantage.
Of the Ethiopians most lived to 120 years, and some
even longer; their food was cooked flesh, and their
drink milk. When the envoys returned and Cambyses
received their account, he fell into a passion,
and marched against the Ethiopians without taking
measures for the supply of provisions or considering
that he was about to march to the end of the world,
but like one distraught and out of his mind, he set
forth on his expedition as soon as he heard the account
of the fish-eaters. No Persian was able to draw the
bow of the Ethiopians; Smerdis alone, the brother
of Cambyses, was able to draw it two finger-breadths.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Cambyses bade the Greeks who were with him (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
crews of the Greek ships) to remain in Egypt; but
the whole of the rest of the army he took with him.
When he came to Thebes, he sent 50,000 men away
with orders to enslave the Ammonians and burn the
oracle of Zeus; with the rest he marched against the
Ethiopians. But before the army had traversed a
fifth part of the way all their provisions were con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>sumed,
and not long after even the beasts of burden
were eaten. If Cambyses when he saw this had
given up his intention, and led the army back, he
would have shown himself a wise man after his first
mistake, but he went recklessly onward. So long as
the soldiers found anything growing on the ground,
they ate herbs and grass; but when they came to
the sand, some of them did a horrid deed; they drew
lots for the tenth man and ate him. When Cambyses
heard of this, he was distressed that the soldiers
should eat each other, abandoned the war against the
Ethiopians, marched back, and reached Thebes after
losing many men. This was the end of the expedition
against the Ethiopians. But with regard to those
who were sent against the Ammonians it is only
known that they reached the city of Oasis where
the Samians dwell, seven days' march distant from
Thebes through the desert; in the Greek language
this place is called the island of the blessed. To this
place the army came; but beyond this no man knows
anything except what the Ammonians say. They
relate that when they marched from the oasis through
the sand and were about midway between the oasis
and the Ammonians, and were eating breakfast, a great
wind from the south blew up a mass of sand and
overwhelmed them, and in this way they perished."
Diodorus represents Cambyses as making the attempt
to subjugate the Ethiopians with a great host, in
which he lost the whole of his army and was in the
greatest danger.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>If the legend of the Greeks of the fortunes of
Psammenitus after his defeat exhibits analogous traits
to the legend, also Greek, of the fate of Cr&#339;sus
after his capture, the account given by Herodotus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of the march of Cambyses against the long-lived
Ethiopians reminds us of his account of the march
of Cyrus against the Massaget&aelig;. In both cases
the aim is directed against unknown foreign nations,
against whom there is no reason to make war; in
both cases good sense, moderation, wisdom, and love
of peace are found in the chief of the barbarians;
in both envoys are sent under false pretences; in
both the conversation on either side is accurately
known. In the first case it is a foolish resolution
which brings ruin; in the second it is the vexation
of Cambyses at the answer of the Ethiopians, and
the inability to draw the bow, which causes him to
lead his army without any hesitation into destruction.
Along with other indications, the test of the bow
here, like the bottle in the other legend, points to a
poetical source.</p>

<p>We have seen that the ancient Pharaohs, the
Sesurtesen and Amenemha, Tuthmosis and Amenophis,
and after them Sethos and Ramses II., had
extended the dominion of Egypt up the Nile to
Semne and Cumne, and subsequently to Mount
Barkal. The Egyptian language, worship, and art
spread in this direction, and with the decline of the
Egyptian power after the time of the Ramessids
(from the year 1100 <small>B.C.</small>), an independent state grew
up, the metropolis of which was Napata, near the
modern Meravi, on Mount Barkal. The princes of
this state in their turn, from king Pianchi onwards,
had forced their way down the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Sabakon,
Sebichos, and Tirhaka had governed Napata and
Egypt. After Sabakon had come into conflict with
the Assyrians at Raphia in Syria (720 <small>B.C.</small>), and
Tirhaka at Altaku (701 <small>B.C.</small>), Tirhaka succumbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in the year 672 <small>B.C.</small> to the arms of Esarhaddon.
Repeated attempts of Tirhaka and his son Urdamane
upon Egypt were wrecked; Esarhaddon calls himself
king of Miluhhi and Cush. Assurbanipal boasts that
he pursued Urdamane as far as the land of Cush.
But the kingdom of Napata, which the inscriptions
of Sargon, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal
call Miluhhi (Meroe<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>)&mdash;in the inscriptions
on Mount Barkal we find the names Meru and
Merua&mdash;continued to exist, and maintained itself
against the restoration of Egyptian power under
Psammetichus and his successors. We cannot doubt
that Cambyses wished to penetrate up the Nile at
least as far as the army of the Assyrians, that he
felt it necessary to secure his dominion in Egypt
against attacks from Napata, and to extend his dominion
as far up the Nile as the army of the old
Pharaohs had reached. That the prince, who, as we
saw, made the most careful preparations for the
campaign against Egypt, should have thrown himself
foolishly and recklessly into this undertaking, as
Herodotus represents, is incredible, and the statement
must be attributed to special tendencies in the sources
used by the historian. So far as Meroe, Herodotus
tells us from information collected at Elephantine
on the southern border of Egypt, the way lay up
and on the Nile. First there were four days' journey
from Elephantine (against the stream), then forty
days' march along the river, since the rocks made
navigation impossible, and then after twelve days'
voyage the great city of Meroe was reached, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
metropolis of the rest of the Ethiopians. The distance
to the place where the Egyptians lived who had
emigrated under Psammetichus (III. 307) was not
less than the distance from Elephantine to Meroe,
and it was a long journey for them to the long-lived
Ethiopians. The total of 56 days' journey from the
way from Elephantine to Meroe upon or along the
Nile points to a place much higher up the river than
Napata. The new Meroe is meant, which the princes
of Napata, receding before the Persians, had founded
before the time of Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Herodotus' statements
that the Ethiopians worshipped Zeus and Dionysus
alone among the gods, and worshipped them very
zealously, that there was an oracle of Zeus in their
country, and that it was only by its command that
they went to war, are completely established by the
monuments of Napata. They show that the worship
of Ammon, the god of Thebes and upper Egypt, and
that of Osiris whom the Greeks, as we know, compared
with their Dionysus, were zealously prosecuted.
From inscriptions and intelligence of other kinds
we have also ample information of the influence of
the priests, and the importance of the oracle in
the kingdom of Napata. The fame of the priesthood
at Napata may be the basis of the "pious Ethiopians"
of Homer; the same piety, though further removed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
is shown in Herodotus' narrative of the long-lived
Ethiopians.</p>

<p>When Cambyses, so Strabo tells us, had made himself
master of Egypt, he advanced to Meroe (Napata),
and it is said that he gave the name to the city in
honour of his wife, or his sister, as others say, who
was buried there. Diodorus indeed tells us that
Cambyses founded the famous city of Meroe, and
gave it the name of Meroe after his mother.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Josephus
also observes that Cambyses changed the name
of the royal city of the Ethiopians and called it
Meroe.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> However unfounded may be the assertion
that the name of Meroe proceeded from Cambyses&mdash;for
we find it used two centuries previously by the
Assyrians&mdash;it is quite clear from these statements that
Cambyses did advance as far as the old metropolis
of the Ethiopians and brought it into his power; that
he conquered and maintained the kingdom of Napata.
Indeed Herodotus tells us elsewhere himself that he
advanced far beyond Napata to the south. "In his
campaign against the long-lived Ethiopians," we are
told in this passage, "Cambyses subjugated the Ethiopians
who dwell around the sacred Nysa, and hold
festivals in honour of Dionysus." The position of the
mythical Nysa, we cannot, it is true, define more
precisely than that a Homeric hymn puts it above
the fountains of the Nile,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and Herodotus himself
places it above Egypt in Ethiopia;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> but inasmuch as
these Ethiopians of Nysa wore leopard and lion skins,
according to Herodotus, and were armed with clubs;
as their arrow-heads were made of sharp stones, and
their lances of the horns of antelopes; as they painted
themselves half red and half white in battle;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
had to pay to the Persians every third year two
hundred logs of ebony, twenty large tusks of elephants,
five boys, and two ch&#339;nixes of unrefined
gold,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Cambyses must have penetrated into the land
of the negroes, the zone of ebony and the elephant.
On the middle course of the Nile in Nubia, and above
Napata, there were tribes akin to the Egyptians; the
land of the negroes began about the union of the
White and Blue Nile. The monuments of Egypt
comprise both populations under the name Cush, the
name of the land of the south, and they exhibit these
southern nations as partly red and partly black. The
Greeks call the red and black inhabitants of the land
of the south, Ethiopians. According to the statements
of Artemidorus of Ephesus and of Agatharchides,
which have been preserved by Strabo and
Diodorus, the land of the elephant-hunters and
ostrich-eaters, who fought with the Ethiopians, men
armed with the horns of the antelope, began south
of the confluence of the Atbara and Bahr-el-Azrek
or Blue River, and the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> At the present time
the region of the ebony-woods and elephants begins
in the marsh at the foot of the Abyssinian Alps;
elephants are not found elsewhere except in some
more northern regions on the Red Sea; and that the
Ethiopians did not acquire the elephants' tusks in the
way of trade is proved by the small amount of gold
which they had to pay as tribute. As we find in the
reliefs of Persepolis and Naksh-i-Rustem, among the
nations of the Persian kingdom, certain figures which
are marked out as negroes by their short, curly hair,
their snub nose, their bare breast and the animal's skin
on the shoulders; as the Ethiopians of Nysa and their
neighbours served, according to Herodotus, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
army of Xerxes, and paid the tribute mentioned, as
Herodotus expressly tells us, even in his day, the
march of Cambyses must have penetrated beyond the
mouth of the Atbara, and Napata must have been
permanently maintained, otherwise such distant tribes
would not have furnished contingents in war fifty
years later, and their tribute would have come to an
end long before Herodotus.</p>

<p>Hence Cambyses did not, as the account of Herodotus
represents, return to Egypt from the upper
Nile without success. On the contrary, he penetrated
much further than the Assyrians, and his campaign
had more lasting results than the conquests of
Tuthmosis III. and Ramses II. on the upper Nile.
The account given by Herodotus of the distress into
which the army fell, the statement that the soldiers
ate each other (which is also told of the expedition
of Cyrus to the Indus), and that the retreat to Egypt
was thus brought about, is hardly compatible with
such results and so firmly-established a supremacy.
Yet we may suppose that Cambyses wished to penetrate
even further than the junction of the White
and Blue Nile, and there fell into difficulties. But
it is probable that quite another incident lies at the
base of the legend of the distress of Cambyses "in
the sand." At Premnis on the Nile, Pliny mentions
"the market of Cambyses;" in Ptolemy the same
place is called "the Magazine of Cambyses." Strabo,
when narrating the campaign which Petronius took
in the year 24 <small>B.C.</small> against Napata, tells us, that
after Petronius had taken Pselchis (140 miles above
Elephantine) he came to Premnis (150 miles further
up the Nile, below Abu Simbel and the falls of Wadi
Halfa), "after he had marched through the sand-heaps
in which the army of Cambyses was buried by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
sudden wind." Thus, five hundred years after the
campaign of Cambyses, the tradition was in existence,
that his army had been buried there. Hence when
Napata had been conquered, and the negro stems
subjugated, when Mount Barkal and the falls of Wadi
Halfa were already behind the army on the return
journey, it was overtaken by a sand-storm in the
neighbourhood of Egypt, and a part of the army,
though not the whole, was buried.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus told us above that Cambyses in his
march against the Ethiopians sent a section of his
army against the Ammonians, to reduce them to
slavery, and burn the oracle of Ammon there. Diodorus
repeats the statement of Herodotus almost in
the same words. Justin observes, that Cambyses
had sent an army for the conquest of the famous
temple of Ammon, but it was overwhelmed by a
storm and masses of sand. Herodotus' narrative of
this campaign cannot have arisen from the source
from which he took the striking traits of his account
of the march against the long-lived Ethiopians. Had
this treated of the march against the Ammonians
it would have given some account of the issue
of it; but Herodotus expressly tells us that only
the Ammonians could give an account of this. His
authority therefore was a Greek-Egyptian tradition.
The Ammonians inhabited the oasis of Sivah, which
lies in the desert to the west of Egypt: the worship
of Ammon was carried there by Egyptian settlers
and Egyptian influence.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> We cannot doubt that
Cambyses, after Cyrene and the tribes of the Libyans
between Egypt and Cyrene had submitted, sent a
part of his army to obtain possession of this oasis.
The oasis of Ammon was well adapted to keep the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Libyans of the coast as well as the Cyrenaeans in
subjection; and was at the same time an important
station for trade, and a desirable point of support
for further undertakings in the West. The command
to enslave the inhabitants of the oasis and burn
the temple, is part of the conception which represents
Cambyses as setting out against the Ethiopians in
a moment of reckless passion. According to Herodotus,
the expedition to Sivah came in seven days
after leaving Thebes to "the Island of the Blest," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
to the oasis El Charigeh, which as a fact is seven
good days' march from Thebes in the desert.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> From
this point the army had to proceed about 500 miles;
at present the caravans go northward from El
Charigeh, then to the west from the oasis of Kasr,
to Sivah. What happened to the army on one of
these routes, no one, Herodotus says, can tell; the
Ammonians declared that it was buried half way
between El Charigeh and Sivah.</p>

<p>It would be rash to connect the heaps of bones
which a traveller in our times saw in the neighbourhood
of the oasis of Kasr with the destruction of
the army of Cambyses,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and it is surprising that the
Persians took the longer route from Thebes, when
the shorter route which led from Memphis to Sivah
was already frequented. Alexander of Macedon, in
order to reach the Ammonians, marched from the
Mareotic Lake along the coast westward to Paraetonium,
then he turned directly to the south, and
in eight marches reached the oasis. A modern
traveller reached it in fifteen days from Fayum, in
1809, and the troops of Mahomet Ali who subjugated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Sivah in 1820 to Egypt (2000 men and 500 camels
with water) reached it in fourteen days. Most remarkable
of all is the fact, that both campaigns of
Cambyses were overtaken by the same disaster. The
direction taken by each does not allow us to connect
the two; the route to Sivah could not be past
Pselchis and Premnis. Yet neither one nor the
other disaster is in itself incredible, though 50,000
men cannot have perished. Some 70 years ago a
caravan of about 2000 souls was buried in a sand-storm
on the road from Darfur to Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> But
even if the division which was despatched against
the oasis of Ammon succumbed to the storms
of the desert, Cambyses maintained the oasis El
Charigeh, which Herodotus calls the city Oasis and
the Island of the Blessed. The magnificent remains
of a temple which Darius the son of Hystaspes caused
to be erected there to the god of the oasis, the ram-headed
Ammon, prove that the oasis was conquered
and held by Cambyses.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Like the undertaking against the Ammonians, the
intention of Cambyses to send the fleet against
Carthage was evidence of his plan of extending his
power to the west, and achieving in Africa what his
father had done in Asia. Herodotus gives the account
of the order commanding the fleet to sail, of
the refusal of the Phenicians, and the abandonment
of the project by Cambyses, according to the tradition
of the Greeks, who together with the Phenicians
made up the fleet of Cambyses and the Greeks in
Egypt. There is no reason to doubt the statement.
By the submission of the Cyrenaeans and Barcaeans
Cambyses became the neighbour of Carthage, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
had lately united the Phenician colonies of West
Africa under her leadership and was eager to oppose
the advance of the Greeks in the west of the Mediterranean,
the settlement of their colonies to the west
of the great Syrtis, and their progress in Sardinia,
Corsica, and Sicily. If the attempt to advance to the
desert to the west of El Charigeh were already wrecked,
if Cambyses had already returned from Napata when
he commanded the fleet to sail against Carthage, new
successes covered that disaster as well as the calamity
of Premnis, and the gain of Carthage was of more
importance than that of the oasis of Sivah. The old
Phenicians of the East, in union with the navy of
the Anatolian cities, was to conquer the new Ph&#339;nicia
of the West. The Greeks no doubt were
ready, but the Phenicians refused. By injuring their
colonies in the West they would have rendered the
greatest service to the rival naval power and trade
of the Greeks; in Anatolia and on the coasts of
Sicily they would probably have given a fatal blow
to their own power by sea. Whether Cambyses saw
this connection of affairs, and felt that the subjection
of Carthage would liberate the independent Greeks
from a dangerous neighbour, and the dependent Greeks
from a rival in trade, or whether he simply gave way
to the refusal of the Phenicians, we cannot decide:
we only know that "as the fleet of the Phenicians
refused,"&mdash;and it formed the preponderating part of
the naval force,&mdash;it was impossible to compel it to go.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE DEATH OF CAMBYSES.</h3>


<p>"When Cambyses returned from Thebes to Memphis,"
so Herodotus narrates, "Apis appeared to the Egyptians.
They put on their best clothes, and made
holiday. Cambyses seeing this, formed the opinion
that they held the festival because misfortune had
happened to him. He summoned the governors of
Memphis, and when they came into his presence
asked them why the Egyptians had done nothing of
this kind when he had been in Memphis before, but
only now that he had lost the greater part of his
army. They replied that their god had appeared
to them, who for a long time had been wont to
appear, and when he appeared all the Egyptians were
delighted. When Cambyses heard this he said that
they lied, and punished them with death. He then
sent for the priests, and when they said the same, he
said that he would soon ascertain whether a tame
deity had appeared to the Egyptians, and commanded
them to bring out Apis. Apis was brought out, and
Cambyses mad as he was drew his sword. He meant
to stab Apis in the belly, but he hit the thigh and
said with a laugh to the priests: 'Wretches, are these
creatures gods, which have flesh and blood, and feel
iron? Such a god is worthy of the Egyptians. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
you shall not mock me for nothing,' He gave command
to scourge the priests and slay every Egyptian
who was found making holiday. In this way the
festival came to an end; the priests were punished,
the Apis died in the temple of the wound in his thigh,
and the priests buried him secretly unknown to
Cambyses.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> But the king remained in Memphis
and raged against the Egyptians, the allies, and the
Persians. He caused the old sepulchres to be opened
and looked at the corpses; he went into the temple
of Hephaestus (Ptah, I. 43), and desecrated the
image of the god in various ways. He also entered
the temple of the Cabiri (belonging to the Phenicians
at Memphis, III. 310), which none but the priests
may enter, and outraged the images and burned
them."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Diodorus observes that Cambyses, as was
said, took away the Golden Zone in the Ramesseum,
which measured 365 cubits, one for each day in the
year, and was a cubit thick.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Justin tells us quite
generally that Cambyses, enraged at the superstition
of the Egyptians, gave orders for the destruction of
the temples of Apis and the other gods.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>In the narrative of Herodotus the best reason given
for the wounding of Apis is the vexation of the king
at the failure of his campaigns against the Ethiopians
and Ammonians, and the refusal of the Phenicians;
and the belief that the festival of Apis was merely an
excuse for making merry over the blows which had
fallen upon him. If Cambyses tells the priests, who
exhibit Apis to him as a god who has recently
appeared to them, that "they lied," it was very difficult
for a worshipper of Auramazda to believe that
a young bull was a god, and the highest god, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the "lie" with which Cambyses charges them, seems
to be an accurate trait corresponding to the conceptions
of the Avesta about the "lying gods," and to the
Zoroastrian respect for the truth. There could hardly
be a more strongly-marked contrast than between the
worship of Auramazda, the creator of heaven and
earth, and surrounded by the light spirits of the sky,
in which no images were allowed, and the rites of
the Egyptians, their worship of numerous images of
the most extraordinary form in splendid temples, their
adoration of the sacred animals, in which these deities
appeared, and were thought to be present,&mdash;between
their anxious care for the preservation of the corpse,
and the eagerness of the Iranians to remove the impure
remains of man. Cambyses might in all honesty
believe that he was in contact with a stupid worship
of idols, a senseless adoration of calves, crocodiles,
and serpents, and a nation of "liars."</p>

<p>But if he held such opinions, he did not act on
them. If he had outraged the worship of Egypt in
the manner represented by the legends of the Egyptians
in Herodotus and Justin, the country could
hardly have remained at rest after his death, when
almost all the other lands rebelled against the Persians.
Egyptian inscriptions prove that under Cambyses
there was no sort of religious persecution, but
quite the reverse. In the tombs of the Apis, on the
plateau of Memphis, on the vestibule of the new
gallery which Psammetichus had caused to be hollowed
out for them, when the old gallery of Ramses II.
was filled, we see on a pillar Cambyses adoring
the Apis. The inscription tells us: "In the year
four, in the month Epiphi, in the reign of Cambyses
(Kambathet), the immortal, the god was brought here
for the burial which the king ordained for him. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
second Apis, the successor of that which was buried,
was born, as the inscription of the Apis tombs tells us,
on the 28th Tybi, in the fifth year of the reign of
Cambyses.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Inscriptions found on the statue of an
Egyptian, Uzahorsun (at present in the Vatican), tell
us that he had been a magistrate under Amasis and
Psammenitus (Psamtik III.), and afterwards under
Cambyses and Darius. 'When the great prince, the
lord of the world, Kambathet,'<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> so we are told in these,
'marched against Egypt, all the nations of the earth
were with him.' He became lord of the whole land,
and settled therein. He was the great lord of Egypt,
the great prince of the whole world, the king of
upper and lower Egypt, Ra-mesut (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Ra born
again<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>). And his holiness conferred on me the dignity
of a counsellor and overseer of the royal gates,
and commanded that I should ever be where he was.
I brought a complaint before his holiness touching
the people who were in the temple of Neith, that they
might be driven out, that the temple might be purified
and clean as before. His holiness commanded
the temple to be purified, and the sacred gifts to be
brought as before to Neith, the great mother of the
great gods who dwell in Sais. And his holiness commanded
to celebrate all the great and little festivals, as
had been done before. This his holiness did because he
had commanded me to announce to him the greatness
of Sais, which is the city of all the gods, who are there
enthroned on their seats for ever. When the king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of upper and lower Egypt came to Sais, he entered
himself into the temple of Neith. He visited the
sacred place of her holiness the goddess, as every king
had done. His holiness did this on the information
which he had received of the greatness of her holiness,
who is the mother of the sun himself. His holiness
performed all the rites in the temple of Neith. He
offered a libation of the lord of Eternity (Osiris) in
the inner chamber of the temple of Neith, as all
kings had done before him. On the command of
his holiness, the worship of Neith, the great mother
of the gods, was re-established in all its completeness
for ever. I have provided the sacred worship of
Neith, the lady of Sais, with all good things, as a good
servant does for his master. I have re-established
the priests in their office, and on the command of the
king have given them rich possessions to be their
own for ever. I have erected a good sepulchre for
him who was without a coffin. I was a good citizen of
my city. I have caused its children to live. I have
set up all their houses; I have shown them every
kindness as a father for his son. I have rescued their
population, when disaster fell upon their canton,
at a time when there was great calamity in all
the land. Never did such calamity fall upon their
land before."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>This inscription, like those on the Apis tombs,
proves that Cambyses in Egypt, like his father in
Babylon, wished to take the place of the old princes
of the land, and did take it; and that he bore the
titles of the ancient Pharaohs, and that a regal-name
Ra-mesut was added to his name, as was the custom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
with his predecessors. He undertook the protection of
the ancient gods of the land; he allowed Egyptians,
servants of the old king's, to come into his immediate
service; he listened to their advice; heard their
complaints about the outrages done to the temple,
which could hardly have been avoided in the occupation
(p. 147), and removed the cause; restored the
priests to the enjoyment of their incomes; showed
respect to their religion, and allowed it to continue
without restriction. However great we suppose the
care to be which the Egyptian inscriptions take to
say no evil of the Persian king, whatever weight we
ascribe to the fact that after the Persians had once
become their masters, the priests followed the traditional
custom in denoting the kings of the Persians
by the titles of their Pharaohs; whatever importance
we allow to the fact that the priests were closely
interested in representing religious affairs as unaltered
even after the change in the rulers, and however
much we deduct from their formal style on the score
of these considerations&mdash;it still remains an established
fact, from these inscriptions, that Cambyses did not
oppress the Egyptians or their religion. The purification
of one of the largest and most sacred temples
in Egypt, the restoration of the priesthood and the
worship at the temple, could not have been ascribed
to Cambyses if the opposite was known to be the
case. On the other hand, the narrative of Uzahorsun
presents us with the natural course of affairs. If he
speaks of a great calamity such as had never before
fallen on the district of Sais and the whole land, this
refers to the conquest of Egypt by the Persians, since
he claims the merit of having rescued the population
at Sais in this calamity. We saw above, from the
narrative of Herodotus, that Cambyses went to Sais,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
after the capture of Memphis. The inscriptions show
that the priests had been driven from the temple of
Neith, that the soldiers were quartered in it, that
sacrifice and worship came to an end. But it also
teaches us that Cambyses removed these evils. Whether
he felt himself called upon to offer gifts in the temple
of Neith and pour libations, or whether the priests
when restored to possession of the temple property did
this on his behalf, is indifferent; the inscription and
Herodotus tell us that he entered the temple in
person. Of the two Apis-bulls which the inscriptions
mention as belonging to the reign of Cambyses, the
first, which was buried in Epiphi of the fourth year
of Cambyses, may have been that which the king is
said to have wounded after his return from Napata.
But Herodotus observes that the priests buried this
Apis "secretly." This is contradicted by the sepulchral
pillar, inasmuch as Cambyses causes a place to
be prepared for the burial of this Apis, and we have
a picture of Cambyses in adoration before this Apis.
The hypothesis, which we might frame, that the priests
have given themselves the satisfaction of representing
Cambyses as entreating the pardon of the god whom
he had slain in a holy place, little visited by the
Persians, would be very artificial and insufficient to
account for this glaring contradiction.</p>

<p>Hence we have to correct in some very essential
points the Greek-Egyptian tradition of Cambyses.
Though the Egyptians might attempt, as we saw, to
change Cambyses into the grandson of their own
Pharaoh Hophra, the people could hardly fail to
attribute evil deeds and crimes to the man who had
deprived their land of its independence, who had
caused them painfully to feel the loss of their pride,
the antiquity and the monuments of their history, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
wisdom and art, a loss which they felt deeply as their
repeated and stubborn rebellions show. But Herodotus
would be the more ready to give credence to
the narrative of the Egyptians of the wounding of
Apis, because it explained the miserable death of
Cambyses as the just punishment for this crime.
Besides there were narratives of the Persians, which
tended to impress on Cambyses the traits which he
bears in Herodotus.</p>

<p>"Smerdis, the brother of Cambyses," so Herodotus
further narrates, "was with him in Egypt. Cambyses
sent him back out of jealousy, because he was able
to draw the bow of the Ethiopians further than all the
rest of the Persians. When Smerdis had returned
to Persia, Cambyses saw in a dream a messenger
from Persia, who told him, that his brother sat up
on the throne and that his head touched heaven.
He was afraid that his brother would slay him and
take possession of the kingdom; hence he sent
Prexaspes the Persian in whom he had most confidence
to Persia to put him to death. Prexaspes
went to Susa, and slew Smerdis as some say, while
hunting with him, but according to others, by taking
him out on the Red Sea (the Persian Gulf) and
throwing him into the water. This was the first
evil deed which Cambyses committed immediately
after his crime against Apis. The second he committed
against his own sister, by the same father
and mother (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> against the youngest of the three
daughters whom Cassandane bore to Cyrus; her
name has not come down to us with certainty).
He was seized with a passion for one of his sisters,
and desired to have her to wife; but as he saw that
this was unusual, for up to this time the Persians
had not taken sisters to wife, he asked the royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
judges (p. 105) whether there was any law which
stood in the way of his wish to marry his sister.
The judges made a reply which was both just and
safe; they could find no law which bade the brother
marry the sister, but they had found a law which
allowed the king of the Persians to do as he pleased.
Then Cambyses married the sister whom he loved,
and after this a second younger sister. The latter
followed him to Egypt. Here she witnessed, together
with Cambyses, a young lion fighting against a young
dog, and when the dog was being beaten, its brother
broke its chain and came to its aid, and the two
together got the better of the lion. Cambyses was
delighted at the sight, but his sister wept. When
Cambyses perceived this he asked the cause of her
tears; she replied that she wept because she thought
of Smerdis when she saw the brother running to help
the brother, and knew that no one would come to
help him (Cambyses). For this speech, the Greeks
say, Cambyses put his sister to death. The Egyptian
account is that at table she took a lettuce, stripped
off the leaves and asked Cambyses whether it looked
better when bare or when full of leaves, and when he
replied that it looked better when full of leaves, she
retorted: 'And yet you have made it bare by desolating
the house of Cyrus.' In a rage Cambyses gave
her a kick, and as she was pregnant, she miscarried
and died. Such was the fury of Cambyses against his
own family, and he was guilty of similar acts against
the Persians. He asked those Persians who sat with
him and Cr&#339;sus what sort of a man he appeared to
be in comparison with his father. They replied that
he was greater than his father; for he possessed all
that Cyrus had possessed, and Egypt and the sea in
addition. This answer did not please Cr&#339;sus, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
said: 'O son of Cyrus, to me thou seemest not to
be equal to thy father, for thou hast not a son to
leave behind thee such as he left in thee'; and when
he heard this Cambyses was pleased and praised the
answer of Cr&#339;sus. He is said once to have asked
Prexaspes whom he most honoured, and who carried
in messages to him&mdash;his son was cup-bearer to
Cambyses, an office of no slight honour&mdash;What do the
Persians think and say of me? Prexaspes replied:
'O Sire, in all other things they praise thee greatly,
but they say thou art too much given to wine.' Cambyses
answered in displeasure: 'So the Persians now
say that owing to wine I am mad and not in my
right mind; their previous answer was untrue.' He
remembered that they had called him greater than
Cyrus, and said to Prexaspes: 'See now for yourself
whether the Persians speak the truth, or whether
they tell foolish tales. There is your son in the
portico; if I hit him in the heart it is clear that the
Persians are wrong in what they say. But if I miss
they are right and I am not in my senses.' The king
drew the bow, hit the youth, ordered the body to
be opened and the wound to be examined. When
it was found that the arrow was in the heart he
laughed, and in great delight said to the father: 'Now
I have proved to you, Prexaspes, that I am not mad,
but that the Persians are out of their senses. Tell
me now, did you ever see such an archer?' As Prexaspes
saw that he was not in his right mind, and
was afraid for himself, he replied: 'I believe that
God himself could not shoot so well.' On another
occasion he caused twelve of the leading Persians
for some trifling cause to be buried alive, head
downwards. Then Cr&#339;sus felt it right to warn him
with words such as these: 'O king, do not yield in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
everything to youth and anger; restrain and bridle
thyself. It is good to look beforehand, and prudence
is wise. Thou slayest men of thy own nation without
good reason and killest youths. If thou persistest
in this, beware lest the Persians fall from thee. Thy
father Cyrus charged and bade me many times to
warn thee and counsel thee for good.' Cambyses
answered: 'Dost thou venture to advise me, who
hast governed thine own land so well, and advised
my father to cross the Araxes against the Massaget&aelig;,
when they were willing to come over the river? A
bad ruler of your country, you have brought yourself
to destruction, and Cyrus also who followed your
advice: you shall not escape me; I have long been
seeking for an excuse to take you.' He seized his
bow in order to shoot him, but Cr&#339;sus escaped and
ran out. As he could not shoot him, he ordered
his servants to seize him and put him to death. The
servants, who knew his manner, hid Cr&#339;sus; if Cambyses
changed his mood and asked for Cr&#339;sus they
intended to bring him and receive presents, but if
not, they would put him to death. Not long after
Cambyses asked for Cr&#339;sus, and the servants said
that he was alive. Then Cambyses said he was glad
that Cr&#339;sus was alive; but those who had preserved
him should not escape, but die; and this sentence he
executed."</p>

<p>"While Cambyses was passing his time in Egypt
two brothers rose up against him, two Magians, one
of whom Cambyses had left behind as the overseer of
his house. This man, whose name was Patizeithes,
rebelled when he found that the death of Smerdis was
concealed, that few Persians knew of it, and the
majority believed him to be alive. Building on this,
he intended to make himself master of the throne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
He had a brother who was very like Smerdis and
had also the same name. When he had persuaded
this brother to take his advice in everything, he put
him on the throne, and sent heralds in every direction,
even to Egypt, to announce to the army that henceforth
they should obey Smerdis the son of Cyrus, and
not Cambyses. The envoy to Egypt found Cambyses
and the army at Ecbatana in Syria; he came forward
and proclaimed his message. When Cambyses heard
this, he thought that what was said was true, that
Prexaspes had betrayed him, and when sent to kill
Smerdis had not done so. He said to Prexaspes: 'Is
this the way you have carried out my commands?'
But Prexaspes answered: 'Sire, it is not true that thy
brother has rebelled against thee, and no war will
ever proceed from him. I myself, after executing
your commands, buried him with my own hands. If
the dead can rise then expect that Astyages the
Mede will rise again; but if things continue as they
have hitherto been, no evil will happen to you from
Smerdis. I think that we should send for the herald
and find out from him by whose order he announces
to us that we are to obey Smerdis.' This advice
pleased Cambyses. The herald was fetched, and
Prexaspes asked him: 'You say that you come as a
messenger from Smerdis, the son of Cyrus. If you
tell us the truth, whether you saw Smerdis when he
gave these orders, or whether you received them from
one of his servants, you shall go away uninjured from
this place.' The man replied: 'Since Cambyses left
for Egypt I have not seen Smerdis; the Magian whom
Cambyses left as overseer of his house gave me these
commands; he said that Smerdis the son of Cyrus
bade me make this proclamation to you.' Then
Cambyses said: 'Prexaspes, you like a brave man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
have done what I commanded, and avoided all blame;
but who of the Persians is it that has taken the
name of Smerdis and revolted against me.' Prexaspes
replied: 'O king, I believe that I understand what has
happened; the rebels are the Magians, Patizeithes,
the overseer of the palace, and his brother Smerdis.'
Then Cambyses was struck with the truth of the
speech, and the fulfilment of the dream, and when he
found that he had killed his brother for no result, he
wept and bewailed his misfortune, and determined to
lead his army with all haste against Susa and the
Magians. But as he was mounting his horse, the
button fell from the end of the sheath of his sword,
and the naked point entered his thigh in the same
place in which he had once stabbed Apis. As he
believed that the wound was mortal, he asked for the
name of the city. He was told that it was Ecbatana.
It had been previously announced to him at Buto that
he would die at Ecbatana; and he believed that he
would end his days as an old man at Ecbatana in
Media. But when he heard the name he was brought
to his senses by the terror of the calamity which
threatened him from the Magians, and by the wound,
and said, with clear understanding of the oracle, that
it was fated for the son of Cyrus to die there. After
some twenty days he caused the most distinguished
of the Persians who were with him to be summoned,
and said: 'Persians, I am brought to such a state
that I must reveal to you what I have most carefully
concealed. When I was in Egypt I saw in my sleep
a dream,&mdash;would that I had never seen it. It seemed
to me that a messenger came from home, who announced
that my brother sat on the royal throne and
touched heaven with his head. Then I was afraid
that my brother was taking the throne from me, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
I acted more rashly than wisely,&mdash;it is not permitted
to human nature to avoid the coming future. I sent,
fool that I was, Prexaspes to Susa to slay Smerdis.
After the crime, I felt myself secure; I never believed
that another would rise up against me after the death
of Smerdis. Wholly in error concerning that which
was to come, I have murdered my brother without
sufficient cause, and am nevertheless deprived of the
sovereignty. It was the rebellion of the Magian
Smerdis which the demon revealed to me in a dream.
This deed I have done: be ye assured that Smerdis,
the son of Cyrus, is no longer alive. The Magian
whom I left behind as overseer of the palace and
his brother Smerdis have obtained possession of the
throne. He who before all others would have averted
this disgrace from me, is no more; he has met his
death by wicked murder at the hands of his nearest
relation. As he is no more, and I am dying, Persians,
I must tell you what to do after my death. And so I
charge you, calling on the royal gods, all of you, but
chiefly the Ach&aelig;menids, who are here present, not to
allow the dominion to pass over to the Medes. If
they obtain it by craft, take it from them by craft; if
they maintain it by force, take it away by yet
stronger force. If ye do this, the earth will bring
forth fruit for you, and your wives will bear children,
and your flocks will increase, and ye will be free men
for all time. But if ye do not acquire the sovereignty
again or attempt to recover it, I pray the gods that
the opposite may happen to you all, and that every
Persian may come to such an end as mine.' When
Cambyses had thus spoken he lamented all the deeds
that he had done, and the Persians rent their garments
and lamented and cried aloud. When the
bone had gangrened and the thigh became inflamed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Cambyses, the son of Cyrus died, after he had sat on
the throne for seven years and four months, without
leaving behind him son or daughter."</p>

<p>If in the narrative given by Herodotus of the fate
of Psammenitus and the campaign of Cambyses against
the Ethiopians we perceived Egyptian and Greek
traditions, and along with them a poetical source,
so in this account of the crimes of Cambyses and his
death we have obviously Greek-Egyptian legends and
echoes of Iranian poetry existing side by side. To
the first we may trace the wounding of Apis, as
already observed, and then the explanation of a
custom which is hinted at in the Avesta, the marriage
with a sister, by the decision of the judges and
the example of Cambyses, the oracle of Buto, and its
explanation by the Syrian Ecbatana, the reason for
the wound in the thigh of Cambyses (the similar
wound inflicted on Apis), and, as we shall see, the
warning of Cr&#339;sus. The legends did not trouble
themselves with the contradiction that, though they
represent Cambyses as outraging Osiris-Apis, and
Ptah, they allow him to ask advice from Egyptian
gods&mdash;a proceeding which is not made more credible
by the fact that Stephanus of Byzantium identifies
the Syrian Ecbatana with Bataneia, and observes
that the city of Hamath (Amatha) was also called
Akmatha, though the invention of the oracle is thus
made more intelligible.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Like his countrymen before
him, Herodotus must have been struck by the contrast
between the long reign, the achievements and successes
of Cyrus, and the short reign and disastrous end of his
son. The Egyptian-Greek tradition explained it by
the wickedness of Cambyses, and this wickedness is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the result of his attack on Apis; the frenzy of Cambyses
begins immediately after this with the murder
of his brother. In Herodotus the frenzy begins even
earlier; the supposed maltreatment of the corpse of
Amasis must belong to the period immediately after
the victory over the Egyptians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the period
before the march to the South, and consequently
Herodotus represents Cambyses as out of his mind
when entering on this campaign, and continuing in
his frenzy till he is compelled to return. The reason
which he gives for this madness is that Cambyses,
though Herodotus represents him in another story as
full of ambitious plans from his youth, was afflicted
from his birth, as it was said, with a severe disease,
which some call "the sacred sickness," and that in
great sickness of the body it was not strange that the
mind also should be affected.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> By the sacred sickness
the Greeks meant epilepsy, or spasmodic attacks in
general, which were ascribed to the anger of the gods.
With complete consistency Herodotus represents the
madness as going on, till Cambyses is seized with
anxiety concerning the rebellion of the Magian, and
finds himself wounded in the thigh. With this
observation he introduces the public confession and
remorse&mdash;the last words of Cambyses. Other Greeks
explain the crimes of Cambyses in a more natural
manner. Diodorus is of opinion that he was naturally
furious and changeful in his moods; the greatness of
the kingdom made him yet wilder and more proud of
spirit, and after the capture of Pelusium and Memphis
he could not bear his prosperity as a man should.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
The "Laws" (of Plato) lay the blame on the education
of Cambyses. In the field from his youth, surrounded
by war and danger, Cyrus left the education of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
sons to the royal women, and overlooked the fact that
his children were not brought up and educated in the
customary Persian manner. The women and eunuchs
brought them up as if they needed no control, and,
while yet mere children, were prosperous and perfect
men. No one was allowed to contradict them; all
must praise what they said or did; thus they grew
up luxurious and uncontrolled; their spirits were
over-full of ambition. When after such adulation
and uncontrolled freedom they grew up and received
the kingdom, one slew the other, enraged at his
equal position, and then, maddened by drink and
debauchery, lost the dominion owing to the Medes
and the so-called eunuch, who despised the foolishness
of Cambyses.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>It is more difficult to trace the tendencies of the
poetical source which has become united with the
legends in the narrative of Herodotus than to separate
the legends themselves, and fix the motives
which have determined the conception and judgment
of the Greeks about Cambyses. From what other
source could the vision of Cambyses, the shot into
the heart of the cup-bearer, have come, or the conversations
of Cambyses with Prexaspes, or the final words
of Cambyses? If these traits are only before us as
fragments at third or fourth hand, their connection
with the narrative of the campaign against the long-lived
Ethiopians is undeniable (the bow of the Ethiopians
is the point of connection). And if we call to
mind that in his last exhortations to his two sons,
Cyrus calls down blessings on the son who remains
well disposed to his brother, and imprecates curses
on the son who is the first to do evil (p. 123), the
structure of the poem becomes clear. It founds the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
misfortune of Cambyses on his disobedience to his
father's command, and exhibits the penalty of disobedience
and crime committed against a brother.
Smerdis is able to draw the bow of the Ethiopian
further than Cambyses and all the other Persians.
This excites envy and jealousy in his brother, who
sends Smerdis back to Persia. Then in a dream
he sees him on the throne, and his head reaches to
heaven. He sends Prexaspes to Persia, who slays
the son of Cyrus in the chase and buries him with
his own hand. The instrument of the murder is
quickly overtaken by punishment. Had Cambyses
slain Prexaspes himself intentionally or in anger,
it would be conceivable; but the murder of his
son is unintelligible. Only poetical justice could
execute vengeance for the fact that Prexaspes had
laid his hand on the son of Cyrus, by representing
Cambyses as slaying with his own hand, without any
personal reason whatever, the son of the man who
by his own command had slain his brother, and who
is best acquainted with this secret crime, the revelation
of which would rouse the hearts of all the
Persians against the king. As the poem goes on, it
has in store even heavier penalties for the man who
has slain the son of Cyrus. But it is not merely the
murder of the young Prexaspes which belongs to a
poetical source. The same authority represents Cambyses
as becoming more and more deeply involved in
guilt and crime against his house. When looking on
at the two dogs which together got the better of
the lion, his sister reminds him of the death of his
brother. In his rage he ill-treats her and so destroys
his long-cherished hope of posterity. The house of
Cyrus is desolate. He has mistrusted his brother
without reason&mdash;the man whom he has trusted and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
made the governor of his palace rebels against him;
he places his brother on the throne as the younger
son of Cyrus, and causes him to be proclaimed as
king. In despair at such calamities, at the ruin of
the kingdom of which he is the guilty cause, Cambyses
ends his days. He pays the penalty of his
heavy guilt by confessing and lamenting his offence
before the assembly of the chief Persians. The curse
of Cyrus is fulfilled. If Herodotus gives the account
of the death of Cambyses after the Greek-Egyptian
legend, he is obviously following Iranian poetry in
the accompanying circumstances and in the speech of
the dying Cambyses. We have Iranian conceptions
in the answer of Prexaspes: "If the dead can rise,
your brother will return"; in the saying of Cambyses
to the Persians: "If ye strive earnestly to win back
the dominion, the earth will bring forth fruit, and
your wives will bear children, and your flocks will
increase." Conceptions and ideas of this kind, expressed
almost in the same words, have met us
frequently in the Avesta. The close of the speech
of Cambyses removes the guilt and points to the
future, for he charges the Persians, and above all the
Ach&aelig;menids, to risk everything that the dominion
may not again pass to the Medes. If the Persians
fight bravely with all the means at their disposal for
the dominion, all will go well with them, if not Cambyses
prays the gods that the reverse may happen to
them; may every Persian die like himself by a most
miserable death, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> by suicide, which the doctrines
of Zarathrustra from their whole tenor must have
most severely condemned.</p>

<p>No doubt the Persian epos had to explain the
contrast in which the reign of Cambyses stood to that
of Cyrus; no doubt it was a fact that the race of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Cyrus came to an end in the male line owing to his
guilt. It was due to him that his reign was followed
by that of an usurper; that rebellion broke out in
all quarters, the kingdom became completely disintegrated,
and the establishment of Cyrus seemed
ruined. The songs of the Persians gave a reason for
the sudden change in the manner indicated, by the
murder of the brother and its results. But they
would not have charged Cambyses with madness or
with any other offences than this combination required.
They would not have forgotten his services
to Persia; the establishment of the Persian power
in the Mediterranean, the victory over Egypt, over
the Ethiopians of Napata, and the negroes. It was
not these poems which branded his campaign to the
south as a mad undertaking, and represented it as
a failure; they could not have opposed Cr&#339;sus as
a wise adviser to Cambyses, or allowed Cambyses to
speak of the miserable end of Cyrus in the land of
the Massagetae. If these elements in the narratives of
Herodotus have not come down from Greek-Egyptian
tradition, if the warning of Cr&#339;sus, in the form in
which we have it, was not attached by him to his
account of the death of Cambyses, we should have
to assume that in this case also the Persian poems
came to Herodotus in their Median counterparts&mdash;a
hypothesis which is excluded by the distinctly ante-Median
and Persian traits in the dying speech of
Cambyses.</p>

<p>Let us see whether information from other sources
puts us in a position to establish the actual connection
of affairs free from the admixture of Greek-Egyptian
tradition and Persian poetry. Ctesias treated
the reign of Cambyses in detail in the twelfth
book of his Persian History. Of this only a meagre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
excerpt has come down to us, according to which the
narrative began with the statement that Cambyses,
in accordance with the last commands of his father,
handed over Chorasmia, Bactria, Parthia, and Carmania
to his brother Tanyoxarkes, as Ctesias calls
him. Then follows the conquest of Egypt, as given
above; and after this we are told: "There was a
Magian of the name of Sphendadates who had committed
some fault and been scourged by Tanyoxarkes.
The Magian went to Cambyses to calumniate his
brother, saying that his mind was set on evil. As a
proof of defection he alleged that Tanyoxarkes would
not come if he were sent for. Cambyses bade his
brother come, but he refused, being occupied with
other business. Then the Magian became more persistent
in his calumnies. Amytis, who saw what
was the Magian's object, warned her son Cambyses
not to trust him. Cambyses pretended not to trust
him, but in reality reposed entire confidence in him.
When Cambyses bade his brother come for the third
time, he obeyed. Cambyses embraced him, but was
none the less determined to put him out of the way;
but he was anxious to carry out his design unknown
to his mother. The deed was accomplished. The
Magian advises the king as follows: He was very
like Tanyoxarkes, the king might give orders that
his head should be cut off as having accused his
brother falsely; he would then secretly slay Tanyoxarkes,
and clothe him (the Magian) in his robes,
so that he might be taken for him. This was done.
Tanyoxarkes died by drinking bull's blood, and the
Magian was clothed in his garments and called
Tanyoxarkes. This was for a long time concealed from
all except Artasyras the Hyrcanian and the eunuchs
Bagapates and Izabates, who were most intimate with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Cambyses; to them alone had Cambyses ventured
to mention the matter. He caused the eunuchs of
Tanyoxarkes and Labyzus, the chief of them, to be
summoned, showed them the Magian thus attired,
and said: Do you believe that this is Tanyoxarkes?
Labyzus was astonished and said: What other man
are we to think that he is? so greatly did the
Magian deceive men by his likeness to Tanyoxarkes.
The Magian was now sent to Bactria, and there
conducted himself in all respects as Tanyoxarkes.
When five years had gone by Amytis learnt what
had been done from the eunuch Tibetheus, whom
the Magian had caused to be beaten. She asked
Cambyses to give up Sphendadates, but he refused.
Then she pronounced her curse, took poison, and died.
When Cambyses sacrificed, the blood of the sacrificial
animals did not flow. He became dejected, and
when Roxane bore him a boy without a head, he
was even more out of heart, and the Magians interpreted
the signs to mean that he could leave no
successor. His mother appeared to him in a dream
and threatened him for the murder, and this made
him more dejected than ever. When he came to
Babylon, by way of pastime he chipped a piece
of wood with a sword, and so hit the muscle of his
thigh, and died on the eleventh day after, when
he had reigned eighteen years. Before his death
Artasyras and Bagapates had resolved that the
Magian should reign; and he reigned after the death
of Cambyses."</p>

<p>The length of the reign of Cambyses is incorrect,
as indeed almost all the numbers in Ctesias are wrong.
It is also a mistake that in his account Cambyses
and his brother are the sons of Cyrus and Amytis
the daughter of Astyages. As we have said, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
were the sons of Cyrus and Cassandane, who died
before Cyrus (V. 384). The object of Ctesias was
to prove the statements of Herodotus incorrect by
opposing them with others. The elevation of Amytis
to be the mother of the brothers, and the part which
the account of Ctesias ascribes to this supposed
mother, shows that Ctesias has here followed a
Median version, in which the daughter of Astyages
became, not the mother of Cyrus, it is true, but the
mother of his successor, the ruler of Persia and
Media,&mdash;the same version which, as we have already
seen, assigns to Amytis the greatest influence on
Cyrus, and in the present instance on his son Cambyses.
Without doubt this version is derived from
a poetical source; that is proved by a number of
traits: the calumniation of the brother, the double
introduction of the scourging, the three-fold summoning
before the king, the conversation of Cambyses
with the eunuch, the three-fold increase of the distress
of Cambyses, the suicide and curse of Amytis, the
signs at sacrifice and the abortion, the appearance
of the dead, which fills up the measure and drives
Cambyses to death. As in the previous case, in this
form of the poems, it was the Median queen who
punished Oebares, who incited Cyrus to revolt, for
this act and for the death of her father, so here she
visits the ruler of the Persians and Medes for his
crime. Against this view of the account of Ctesias
it may be urged that the Medes would take the side
of the Magian more vigorously than that of Amytis,
for the Magian was apparently a Mede. Herodotus, at
any rate, once represents Gobryas as calling him
a Mede.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Cambyses, it is true, does not call him
so, but in his last speech merely urges the Persians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
not to let the empire revert to the Medes, which
means no more than that the empire is not to go
back to the Medes on the extinction of the house of
Cyrus, when his kingdom is being broken up. We
shall see that the usurper was not a Mede, and is
only called a Mede by Herodotus because he wrongly
thought that all the Magians were exclusively Medes
(V. 194). But as the story of Ctesias obviously
goes back to a poetical source, we are not carried
any further by it in establishing the actual facts of
the case.</p>

<p>A third story of the death of Cambyses, that of
Trogus, is also retained in an excerpt only. It is
apparently taken from the Persian history of Deinon.
"Cambyses added Egypt to the kingdom of his
father. Enraged at the superstition of the Egyptians,
he commanded the temples of Apis and the other gods
to be destroyed. He also sent an army to conquer
the far-famed temple of Ammon, but it was overwhelmed
by storms of sand. Then in a dream he
saw his brother as the future king. Terrified by this
vision, he did not hesitate to add the murder of a
brother to the burning of temples. For this horrible
service he sent Cometes, a Magian, one of his trusted
servants. Meantime, his sword coming accidentally
out of the sheath, he wounded himself deeply in the
thigh, and died, as a penalty either for the murder of
his brother which he had commanded, or for the
burning of the temples. When the Magian heard this
he hastened to commit the crime before the news of
the death of the king was spread abroad; and when
he had killed Smerdis, to whom the throne belonged,
he brought in his brother Oropastes. This brother
was very like Smerdis in form and feature; and as no
one suspected the deception, Oropastes became king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
instead of Smerdis. The matter was the more secret
because among the Persians the king lives in retirement
by reason of his majesty."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Darius, in his inscriptions on Mount Behistun, has
left us the authentic though very compressed history
of Cambyses. "Kambujiya, the son of Kurus," he
tells us, "was of our race, was previously king here.
This Kambujiya had a brother, Bardiya by name, of
the same father and mother as Kambujiya. Kambujiya
slew this Bardiya. When Kambujiya had slain
Bardiya the people did not know that Bardiya was
dead. Then Kambujiya marched against Egypt. When
Kambujiya marched against Egypt the people became
rebellious, and the lie spread both in Persia and in
Media and in the other provinces. There was a man,
a Magian, Gaumata by name; he rose up from
Pisiyauvada, from mount Arakadris, which is there.
It was in the month Viyakhna, on the fourteenth
day, that he rose up. He lied to the people; I am
Bardiya, the son of Kurus, the brother of Kambujiya.
Then the whole kingdom rebelled against Kambujiya;
it went over to the other, both Persia and Media and
the rest of the provinces. He took them for his own;
he was king; he seized the empire. In the month
Garmapada, on the ninth day, it was that he seized
the dominion. Then Kambujiya died, for he took his
own life."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Hence we may establish the true course of events
in something like the following form. Cyrus made a
certain division of the kingdom; under the sovereignty
of the elder son he assigned to the younger
Chorasmia, Bactria, Parthia, and Carmania, and thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
sowed the germ of contention between the brothers.
The younger was called Bardiya. This name sounded
to the Greek as Berdis, and then it passed into
Smerdis, as Bagabukhsa becomes Megabyzus.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> If
Xenophon calls Smerdis Tanaoxares, and Ctesias
Tanyoxarkes, this can only be an epithet which the
Persians gave to Smerdis. The old Bactrian <i>thanvarakhshathra</i>
would mean king of the bow. The
Persians might give this name to Smerdis, as their
poems celebrate him as the best drawer of the bow;
it was this superiority of Smerdis which, according to
the poems of the Persians, aroused the jealousy of
Cambyses. The tradition of Iran can tell of the
three best shots that were ever made:<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>&mdash;the best was
made by Arshana, the son of Kava Kavata (V. 37,
253); and king Bahram Gor slays his beloved because
she does not sufficiently admire his skill with
the bow.</p>

<p>Bardiya did not accompany his brother to Egypt;
so that he could not have been sent back from thence.
On the contrary, Cambyses had conceived a suspicion
of him even before the campaign to Egypt; he was
afraid that his brother in Bactria would make use of
the distance at which he would be to seize the throne
in secret, and the more extensive the conquests which
Cambyses intended to make in Africa the more
dangerous would the possibility appear to him. He
caused him to be put to death before he set out to
Egypt. His death remained a secret. By whom and
how Bardiya was killed, and how the secret was kept,
whether by an arrangement such as that described by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Ctesias or by some other means, we cannot decide.
The kingdom, the Persians, and the princes of the
Persians did not know but that Bardiya was alive.
But the Magian Gaumata is aware of the fact. Of
the writers of the West, Trogus Pompeius alone gives
the true name of the usurper in the Grecised form
of Cometes. As the name is correct in Trogus, the
name of the brother of Cometes, whom he calls Oropastes,
may also be correct. But the narrative in
the excerpt in Trogus must be so far altered in
accordance with the version of Herodotus that Cambyses
left Oropastes behind as overseer of the palaces,
and that he placed his brother Gaumata on the throne.
In Ctesias the man who suggests the murder becomes
himself the false Bardiya and the future king. The
inscription of Darius speaks only "of the Magian
Gaumata," of "his leading adherents." The rebellion
of Gaumata was not delayed till the death of Cambyses,
as Ctesias supposed. It occurred, as the inscription
shows, while he was still on the Nile. During
the absence of Cambyses the lie spread in Persia,
Media, and the rest of the provinces. The inscription
mentions the day on which Gaumata rebelled, and the
place where it happened: at Pisiyauvada in mount
Arakadris this false Bardiya arose. As the position
of this place and mountain is not defined, as is elsewhere
the case in the inscription of Darius, by the
addition of the name of the country, we may assume
that it was in Persia that the false Bardiya, as his
interests and the position of affairs required, came
forward, and that he first called on the Persians to
acknowledge him as king and lord of the realm, as
indeed he must have done if he desired success. The
inscription does not tell us that Gaumata was a Mede,
or that the Medes first recognized him as their king;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
it merely says: on the fourteenth of the month
Viyakhna (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the spring of the year 522 <small>B.C.</small>) the
whole kingdom rose in rebellion against Cambyses,
both Persia and Media and the rest of the provinces.
We shall see below that even after the fall of Gaumata
it was not Media which gave the sign for rebellion
against his murderers, but that that country followed
the example of the Elamites and Babylonians, and
was led by Uvakhshathra, a man of the race of
Cyaxares. First Persia, then Media, then the rest of
the lands recognized the false Bardiya as their king;
"he took from Cambyses Persia, Media, and the rest
of the provinces," says the inscription. Then in the
month of Garmapada (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in July or August) the false
Bardiya was crowned at Pasargadae (V. 358). That
Gaumata was recognized as king in Babylonia is not
only proved by the assertion of Darius, but also by
two Babylonian tablets, which are dated from the
20th Elul and 1st Tisri "in the first year of king
Barziya."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> On the news of the rebellion Cambyses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
makes Aryandes satrap of Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and sets out
against the usurper. On this march, at Ecbatana
in Syria, according to Herodotus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> at Batanea
or Hamath, or at Babylon, as Ctesias asserts, or on
the return to Damascus, according to Josephus,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> he
died.</p>

<p>However dark may be the shadows which fall on
the figure of Cambyses, it has received blacker traits
than truth can confirm in the legends of Greece and
Egypt, and, to some extent, in the poems of Media
and Persia. We have mentioned the story which
ascribes to him ambitious plans in his boyish years;
in the estimate which the Persians form of him
according to their poems it is only his love of wine
which is reprobated. More important is the judgment
which the Persians really passed on Cambyses;
Herodotus tells us they called Cyrus the father,
but Cambyses, because he was severe and ambitious,
they called the master.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> From this sentence&mdash;from
despotic severity and violence, whatever may have
been the degree in which they were present&mdash;it is a
long way to the picture of the frantic tyrant which
Herodotus has sketched on the basis of these legends
and poems. What we know by credible tradition
of the crimes of Cambyses, apart from his act against
his brother, and the supposed outburst of rage against
his sister, is limited to the penalty which he imposed
upon Memphis for the murder of the herald and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the crew, and the punishment of Sisamnes, one of
the seven judges who was found guilty of bribery
and unjust judgment. He had him executed, the
corpse was flayed, and the judge's seat covered with
the skin, on which the son, who was named his successor,
was to give judgment.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The punishment of
Memphis cannot be called cruel in the spirit of these
times; and the punishment of the unjust judge is
in the manner of an oriental prince who loves justice.
The reign of Cambyses was undoubtedly marked
by the effort to continue the acts of his father, and
in this effort he shows both vigour and resolution.
The idea of creating a fleet for the Persian empire
was bold and happy, and bore fruits in the submission
of Cyprus and Samos without a blow. The preparations
for the campaign against Egypt were made
with great prudence, and proved adequate and effectual.
But even before he set out for Egypt he
had cast the lot which decided his life. How far
the conduct of his brother, which is suggested in the
version of Ctesias, excused the suspicion of Cambyses,
we cannot decide.  He did not venture to leave
the kingdom so long as his brother ruled over the
eastern half of it; he feared his rebellion during
his absence, and removed him out of the way. The
painful secrecy of the deed shows that Cambyses was
tormented with remorse and shame for this crime.
At the gates of Egypt he conquered in a mighty
battle. He used the victory to storm the strong
border fortresses of Egypt, and then at once turned
against Memphis, the most important city and fortress
of the enemy. The treatment of the captive Psammenitus
repeats the mild manner of Cyrus towards
conquered princes; we have seen above what clemency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Cambyses showed after the conquest was completed towards
the Egyptians and their temples. In possession
of Egypt, he intended to achieve in Africa what
his father had done in Asia; far to the south and
west the country was to be subject to the Persians.
The campaign against Napata led to the conquest
of that kingdom. By maintaining this conquest, the
supremacy of Persia over Egypt was rendered secure
from attacks on that side, and the negro tribes to
the south of Napata were kept in obedience, though
previously they had been visited by the Pharaohs
only in flying incursions. It was at Napata that,
according to the tradition preserved by Diodorus,
Strabo, and Josephus, Cambyses lost his sister, and
with her the hope of an heir, by his own brutal
violence, as the songs represent, when his sister reminded
him of the death of his brother. But Strabo
and Diodorus observe, as has been shown above, that
he named the city after his sister "to honour her."
No doubt the disquiet of his conscience increased the
longer he remained without children. What was to
become of the kingdom after his death? The brother,
whom he had killed, had only left a daughter.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Burdened with new anxiety, if not with new guilt,
he turned back from Napata. The disaster, which
befell the army at Premnis, and the failure of the
expedition against the oasis of Sivah, though it did
not involve the loss of 50,000 men, might seem to
him proofs that he had brought upon himself the
anger of Auramazda and Mithra. Then the Phenicians
refused to march against the Carthaginians,
and he was unable to compel them. The absence
of any heir, the misfortunes which had fallen upon
him, increased his inward torments. He became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
more distrustful, passionate, and savage. He may
have sought forgetfulness in wine, but the remedy
only increased his violence. He shrank from seeing
again his home and the desolate house of Cyrus,
and remained inactive and irresolute for a year
and a half in Egypt; in spite of the danger which
attached to the absence of the ruler of so vast a
kingdom.</p>

<p>In Persia and the provinces nothing was known
of the death of Bardiya. The neglect of the kingdom,
the absence of the king for three years, inspire
Gaumata with the courage to make use of his opportunity,
and turn the secrecy of the crime against
Cambyses. The Persians declare for the brother who
is among them, as against the distant king who
seemed to have forgotten Persia in Egypt; even the
satraps of the other countries soon decide in favour
of Bardiya, as for years they had seen nothing of
Cambyses. In three months after his appearance
Gaumata was formally crowned. The account of the
rebellion startled Cambyses from his stupor in Egypt;
he placed a satrap over the conquests he had made
and hastened to Syria, where he learnt the full amount
of the usurper's success. With anger he sees the
crown of Cyrus on the head of a miserable pretender.
If he is effectually to contend against the opponent
who has risen to such power, he must acknowledge
himself before the Persians and the kingdom as the
murderer of his brother, and even if he makes this
shameful confession, will the Persians believe and
follow him? Will they not think that he announces
the murder in order to thrust his brother from the
throne? In despair he perceives that he has destroyed
the house of Cyrus, and ruined the work of his father,
the fruit of thirty years of effort and struggle. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
sees no means of preventing the course of affairs, the
ruin of the kingdom of which he is the cause. He
acknowledges before the princes of the Persians what
he has done, commands them to make good the
damage which he has caused, and seals his declaration
by taking his own life. Such was the tragical end
of the son of the great Cyrus.</p>

Cambyses is 522 <small>B.C.</small> According to Herodotus, Cambyses reigned
seven years and five months, and the Magian more than seven months;
the two make up eight years. The number of the Persian days of
the month are repeated in the Babylonian version of the Behistun
inscription. Hence the Persians adopted the year of the Assyrians
and Babylonians as well as their cuneiform writing, but they had
independent names for the months. Unfortunately the names of the
months in the Babylonian text are more frequently destroyed than not,
so that we can only be certain in giving Kislev (November-December)
as corresponding to the Athriadiya of the Persians, Tebet (December-January)
to Anamaka, Iyar (May-June) to Taigarshis. Oppert
maintains that we can also identify the Babylonian Adar or Veadar
(Febr.-March) with the Viyakhna of the Persians; but the text is
uncertain in this passage. Finally, we may with tolerable certainty
regard Garmapada (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the path of heat) as corresponding to July and
August, to the Tammuz or Ab of the Babylonians. If Viyakhna is
really Adar, the proclamation of the Magian took place in March, 522
<small>B.C.</small>, and his coronation in Garmapada (July and August). This
according to Darius was followed by the death of Cambyses. The two
tablets quoted date from September and October in the first year of
Barziya. According to Herodotus, the Magian reigned more than seven
months after the death of Cambyses, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> down to the spring of 521 <small>B.C.</small>
According to the inscription of Behistun, Darius slew him on the tenth
of Bagayadis (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> sacrifice to the gods), which would thus be parallel
to the Nisan of the Babylonians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to our April.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE RISE OF DARIUS.</h3>


<p>"The Persians, when they heard the words of Cambyses,"
so Herodotus continues his narrative, "did
not believe that the Magians had possessed themselves
of the throne; on the contrary, they thought that
Cambyses had said what he had said of the death
of Smerdis in order to deceive them, that the whole
of Persia might rise against Smerdis. They believed
that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was on the throne; for
even Prexaspes solemnly denied that he had slain
Smerdis; after the death of Cambyses it was dangerous
for him to allow that he had put to death the
son of Cyrus with his own hand. The Magian who
had taken the name of Cambyses reigned in security
and showed great mildness to all his subjects. Immediately
after he had got possession of the throne,
he proclaimed freedom from military service and
tribute for three years to all the nations over whom
he reigned. But in the eighth month of his reign
it was discovered who he was. Otanes, the son of
Pharnaspes, was one of the first of the Persians in
descent and wealth. He first conceived a suspicion
of the Magian because he never went out of the
citadel, nor allowed any of the leading Persians to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
approach him. Phaedyme, the daughter of Otanes,
had been the wife of Cambyses, and with the rest
of the wives she had passed over to the Magian.
Otanes caused the question to be put to his daughter,
whether the man with whom she lay was Smerdis
the son of Cyrus, or another. She replied that she
had never seen Smerdis, and could not tell who he
was. Then Otanes sent a second time: 'If you do
not know Smerdis, ask Atossa, with whom you and
she lie, for she will know her own brother.' The
daughter answered: 'I cannot speak with Atossa, or
see any other of the women, for since this man,
whoever he is, came to the throne, he has kept us
all apart, and sent one in one direction, and another
in another.' When Otanes heard this, the matter
became yet clearer. He sent a third message to his
daughter, saying: 'My daughter, you are come of a
noble race and must accept the risk which your
father lays upon you. If this man is not Smerdis
the son of Cyrus, but the person whom I suspect that
he is, he must not go unpunished for associating with
you, and exercising dominion over the Persians. Do
as follows: When you perceive that he is asleep, feel
for his ears. If he has ears, be sure that he is the
son of Cyrus, but if he has none he is Smerdis the
Magian.' Phaedyme sent an answer to her father,
saying that she would run the greatest risk in doing as
he bade, for if the man had no ears, and she was found
feeling for them, he would put her out of the way;
however, she would do it. And when it came to her
turn to go to the Magian, she did all that her father
had bidden her; she lay with him, and when he was
asleep she felt for his ears, and easily discovered
that he had none. When Cyrus was king he had
for some grave reason cut off this man's ears. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
it was day she sent her father word how the matter
stood."</p>

<p>"Otanes related all the circumstances to Aspathines
and Gobryas, who were the first among the Persians
and most worthy of confidence, and as they had also
had their suspicions that the case was so, they listened
to the proposals of Otanes. The three were of opinion
that each should join with him the Persians whom he
counted most worthy of confidence. Otanes brought
Intaphernes; Gobryas, Megabyzus; and Aspathines,
Hydarnes. To these six at Susa, Darius the son of
Hystaspes came from Persia, for Hystaspes was
satrap of Persia, and when he came, the six resolved
to make him their associate. They met, pledged
mutual fidelity, and took counsel. And when it
came to Darius' turn to give his opinion, he said: 'I
believed that I alone knew that the Magian was king,
and that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was dead, and for
that reason I came with haste to put the Magian to
death. But as I feel that you also know this and not
I only, we must at once proceed to action without
delay; for that will be dangerous.' Then Otanes
spoke: 'O son of Hystaspes, thou art the son of a
brave father, and thou showest thy courage not less
than he. But do not so hasten the matter without
consideration; begin it with prudence. We must be
more numerous, and then make our attempt.' Darius
replied: 'Ye men that are present, if ye enter on the
matter as Otanes wishes, ye will come to a shameful
end. Some one who seeks his own advantage will
betray the matter to the Magian. Ye ought to have
taken the matter on yourselves and so accomplished it.
But as ye have resolved to take in more confederates,
and have confided the matter to me, it must be done
to-day. If this day passes by, I tell you that I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
allow no informer to be before me; I will myself
betray you to the Magian.' When Otanes saw Darius
so eager, he said: 'As you compel us to hasten the
matter and allow no delay, tell us how shall we enter
the palace and overcome them? You know yourself&mdash;if
you have not seen, you have heard&mdash;that guards
are set; how shall we pass by them?' 'Many things,'
Darius said, 'may be proved by deeds and not by
words; other things may be done in word but no
brilliant deed corresponds to them. You know that
it is not difficult to pass through the guards that
are set. No one will prevent men of our rank; one
will give way from respect, another from fear. Then
I have an excellent excuse for passing through, if I
say that I have just come from Persia and have to
give a message from my father to the king. If an
untruth must be told, let it be told. If a man seeks
for no advantage to himself by his untruth, he who
tells the truth may be a liar, and he who lies may
be a truthful man. If any of the door-keepers allow
us to pass willingly by, this will be in the future an
advantage for him, but any one who opposes us will
show at once that he is our enemy; we will then
force our way and begin the work.' Then Gobryas
said: 'We can never with greater honour win back
the empire, or, if we fail, find a more honourable
death. Are not we Persians ruled by a Mede, a
Magian, a fellow without ears? Those of you who
were with Cambyses when sick remember what he
imprecated on the Persians if they did not seek to
regain the dominion. At that time we did not believe
him, we thought that he spoke to deceive us. Now I
give my vote to you, Darius, and go straight from this
consultation to the Magian.' So Gobryas spake and
all agreed with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"While they were thus deliberating, the following
incident happened. After solemn deliberation it
seemed advisable to the Magians to make Prexaspes
their friend; he had been cruelly treated by Cambyses,
he alone knew of the death of Smerdis, and
was of great influence among the Persians. For this
reason they sent for him, and sought by pledges and
oaths to bind him not to reveal to any one the deception
he had practised on the Persians, and they
promised him everything in their power.  When
Prexaspes agreed to do as they wished, they further
proposed that he should summon the Persians under
the walls of the citadel; mount a tower and tell them
that they were governed by Smerdis and by no other.
This request the Magians made because the Persians
had great confidence in Prexaspes, and he had
repeatedly told them that Smerdis was alive and his
death a fiction. When Prexaspes declared his readiness
they summoned the Persians to the tower and bade
him speak. But he, purposely forgetting what they
had requested, began to speak of the race of Cyrus,
and when he came to Cyrus himself he enumerated
the blessings which he had provided for the Persians,
and going yet further he revealed the truth, declaring
that he had concealed it before because it was dangerous
for him to say what had been done, but now the
necessity was laid upon him to reveal it. And now
he said, that, compelled by Cambyses, he had slain
Smerdis, and that Magians were on the throne. When
he had imprecated a bitter curse upon the Persians if
they did not win back the kingdom, and take vengeance
on the Magians, he threw himself head foremost
down from the tower. All his life he had been an
honourable man, and such he died.</p>

<p>"When they had resolved to attack the Magians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
without delay, the seven Persians invoked the gods,
and set forth on the way, without knowing what had
happened to Prexaspes. When they had proceeded
half the distance, they heard of it. They slipped aside
to consider the matter. And Otanes with some others
were of opinion that they must wait, for all would be
in confusion, but Darius and the rest declared that
without hesitation they must carry out what they had
resolved upon. While they were thus at variance,
seven pairs of hawks appeared, which pursued and
tore to pieces two pairs of vultures. When the
seven saw this they all took the view of Darius, and
encouraged by the birds, went to the palace. When
they reached the gates it happened as Darius expected.
The guards respectfully allowed the first
men among the Persians to pass through, as though
they were led by some divine guide; no one suspected
them, and no one asked any questions. But when
they came to the portico, they came upon the eunuchs
who carried messages in to the king. These asked what
they wanted, threatened the guards for allowing them
to pass, and detained them. The conspirators encouraged
each other, drew their swords, struck down
those who sought to detain them, and burst at a run
into the hall. The two Magians were there at the
time, consulting about the affair of Prexaspes. When
they heard the noise and the cry of the eunuchs, they
sprang up to see what was the matter, then hastened
back and made ready for defence. One seized a bow,
the other a spear. The first could not use the bow,
for the conspirators were close upon him, but the
other wounded Aspathines in the thigh and hit
Intaphernes in the eye. The Magian with the bow
retired into a dark chamber off the hall, and wished to
close the door, but Darius and Gobryas hastened after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
him; Gobryas seized and held him, and when Darius
hesitated to strike lest in the darkness he should hit
Gobryas, Gobryas cried out: 'Strike even though you
pierce us both.' Darius did so and smote the Magian
only. When both were slain, their heads were cut off;
the two conspirators who were wounded remained to
guard the citadel; the other five rushed out, called
the Persians together, and showed them the heads.
When the Persians heard of the deception of the
Magians, and what had happened, they thought it
right to do the same; they drew their swords, and
slew every Magian whom they could find, and had
they not been prevented by the approach of night,
not a Magian would have been left."</p>

<p>The account given by Trogus of the overthrow of
the Medes, so far as it has been preserved to us,
differs only in unimportant points from the narrative
of Herodotus. In order to gain the favour of the
people, the Magians remitted the tribute and military
service for three years. This first excited suspicion
in the mind of Otanes, a Persian of great position and
discernment. He commanded his daughter, who was
among the royal concubines,&mdash;they were secluded
from each other,&mdash;to feel the ears of the king when
asleep, for Cambyses (in Herodotus it is Cyrus) had
cut off both the ears of the Magian. "Informed by
his daughter that the king had no ears, he announced
this to the princes of the Persians, urged them to put
the false king to death, and bound them by an oath.
Seven persons shared in the conspiracy; and to prevent
any change of opinion in time, or any disclosure,
they at once put their swords under their garments
and went to the palace. They cut down all who
came in their way, and so reached the Magians, who
were not wanting in skill to defend themselves; with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
drawn weapons they slew two of the conspirators (in
Herodotus these are only wounded), but they were
overpowered by numbers. Gobryas seized one of them,
and when his companions hesitated to strike lest they
should pierce him along with the Magian, for the affair
took place in a dark room, he called out to them to
strike even through his own body. But by good
fortune he was uninjured and the Magian was slain."</p>

<p>In the narrative of Ctesias, as we have seen, there
is but one Magian, Sphendadates, whom Cambyses
himself had placed on the throne of Bactria in the
place of his murdered brother (Tanyoxarkes), and
had commanded him to play his part. Astasyras,
Bagapates, and Izabates are aware of the secret.
After Cambyses, Sphendadates becomes king, whom
Astasyras and Bagapates had determined to assist to
the throne even before the death of Cambyses. "When
the Magian was reigning under the name of Tanyoxarkes,
Izabates came out of Persia, where he had
brought the body of Cambyses, revealed all to the
army, and insulted the Magians. Then he fled to
the sanctuary, where he was seized and his head cut
off. Then seven distinguished Persians met, and after
pledging their faith mutually, they joined with themselves
Artasyras and then Bagapates who had the
keys of the royal citadel. And when the seven were
admitted by Bagapates to the citadel, they found the
Magian with a concubine from Babylon. When he
saw them, he sprang up, and as he had no weapons&mdash;for
Bagapates had secretly removed them all&mdash;he
broke up a golden chair, and fought with the foot
of this till he was cut down by the seven. He had
reigned seven months."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Herodotus' narrative of the death of the Magians
again points to a poetical source. In the speech of
the dying Cambyses, in the curse which he imprecates
if the kingdom is not maintained and recovered, and
the indication that it must be done by force and
treachery, this source introduces the new series of
events in an attractive and exciting manner. But
the concealment of the truth, the secret murder of
his brother, have evil consequences which extend
beyond the life of Cambyses. The Persians did not
believe him; they thought that when dying he wished
to make them the enemies of his brother. It required
the penetration of Otanes, the courage and devotion
of his daughter, to bring the truth to light. At first
Otanes prudently admits two men only into the
secret; each of the three then discloses it to a trusty
friend, and when Darius comes from Persia to Susa
all are agreed to make him a confederate. His high
mission has already been indicated in the poem
by the dream of Cyrus wherein he saw the son of
Hystaspes with wings on his shoulders, one of which
overshadowed Asia, the other Europe. Darius urged
the confederates to immediate action. The faint
justification of the deception which we find in Herodotus
shows that in this matter an attempt was made
in the poetical source to keep in harmony with the
Iranian view of the absolute necessity of telling the
truth. The decisive moment approaches nearer and
with greater force to the Magians. They have won
the throne by treachery, they maintain it by cunning,
inasmuch as they demand neither tribute nor soldiers
from the subject countries; but at length they suffer
for their treachery. They attempt to gain Prexaspes;
he is to declare publicly that the Magian is the son
of Cyrus. Prexaspes proceeds apparently to do this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
but he is resolved to use the freedom of speech which
the Magians allow him for their ruin. He reveals the
truth before all the people, and throws himself down
from the tower. The punishment which the poem
has already inflicted on Prexaspes for the murder
of Bardiya in the death of his own son (p. 185) is
not sufficient. Like the king at whose command he
sinned, Prexaspes ends his days by suicide. It is
only by this complete revelation of the truth, this
voluntary death, and tragic end, that he makes complete
atonement for laying his hand on the son of
Cyrus. Thus the figure of Prexaspes belongs to the
series of faithful Persians, who, like Oebares, knew
how to serve not the king only but the prosperity of
Persia with complete devotion. While this took place
before the citadel, and the Magians in terror deliberated
what they should do, now that the proceeding
which was to establish their dominion had dashed
them to the ground, the conspirators were already on
the way. Once more the prudent Otanes hesitates;
and once more Darius urges haste. But the princes
of the Persians must perform the act alone; they
cannot wait for the effect of the revelation of Prexaspes
on the people. The gods themselves give them
a sign; the seven hawks tear to pieces the two vultures.
The poem closes with the death-struggle of
the Magians, the readiness of Gobryas to allow himself
to be slain with the Magian, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the false king,
and the happy restoration of the dominion of the
Ach&aelig;menids.</p>

<p>The objections which can be made against this
poetical account of the matter are obvious. The disbelief
of the Persians in the admissions of Cambyses
is hardly credible. If they had doubted at the first,
they could doubt no longer when the king had sealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
his accusation by his despair and death. When
Otanes imparts his discovery to Gobryas and Aspathines,
they say that "they had already suspected
it;" Darius then comes, and when he has been unanimously
received into the conspiracy he says: "that he
had hitherto believed that he alone knew the secret,
and had hastened from Persia in order to slay the
Magian." The poem has no doubt inserted this scepticism
of the Persians to explain why they did not rise
against the usurper immediately after the death of
Cambyses. The discovery by the absence of the ears
must also belong to the poem; it is a tale of the
harem, in the manner of the poetry of the East. The
deed of Prexaspes, whose place is taken by Izabates in
Ctesias, is quite incredible and impossible in the context
of Herodotus. The Magians had no reason whatever
to urge Prexaspes to a public explanation; no one
among the people had any suspicion; seven men only
are acquainted with the truth, and the Magians have
no intimation of their knowledge. If Susa was the
scene of the deed, the Magians acted still more perversely,
and Prexaspes sacrificed himself at any rate
without the hope of any immediate effect. The
Susians had not the least interest in the legitimacy or
illegitimacy of the king. If the Ach&aelig;menids were no
longer their masters, so much the better, inasmuch as
they now enjoyed that mild dominion, which Herodotus
himself ascribes to the Magians. In the narrative
of the conspiracy two factors are obviously
combined. Otanes is the originator, Darius joins the
band later, but has already resolved to slay the Magi.
Supported by Gobryas he urges immediate action, and
indeed forces the conspirators to act by the threat
that, if there is any delay, he will himself reveal the
conspiracy, while Otanes, both in the deliberation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and on the way to the palace, is in favour of delay.
It was obviously the effect of the poem to bring
plainly into light the merit which, on the one hand,
Otanes and the five conspirators, and on the other
Darius, had earned in the great achievement of the
overthrow of the Magi, and to apportion a part of it
to each section. The eminent position which the
poem allots Otanes is explained by the advantages
and privileges which the house of Otanes enjoyed in
Persia above the other tribal princes, and which were
attributed to the part which he took in the removal of
the dominion of the Magi.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> According to Herodotus
Otanes was the son of Pharnaspes, and his sister
Cassandane was the wife of Cyrus, the mother of
Cambyses and Smerdis. He was thus the uncle of
the king and of Smerdis; and he was also the father-in-law
of the king, for his daughter Phaedyme was
among the wives of Cambyses. This is the account
of Herodotus. But we have convincing evidence that
Otanes was not the son of Pharnaspes. As the father-in-law
of Cambyses he was sufficiently near the throne
to take a leading part in the action. Hystaspes, the
father of Darius, had already been sent back by Cyrus
from his camp on the Jaxartes (p. 115), according to
Herodotus, in order to keep watch over his son Darius.
In Herodotus Hystaspes is now overseer of Persia, and
his son comes to Susa, to slay the Magians with his
own hand. In another passage Herodotus himself
relates that Darius was sprung from the family of the
Ach&aelig;menids; Hystaspes was the son of Arsames, who
was the son of Ariaramnes, the brother of Cambyses
I. the father of Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>It is a fact that Darius was sprung from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
younger line of the house of Ach&aelig;menes. The elder
son of Teispes, the son of Ach&aelig;menes, was Cambyses
I., and the younger son was Ariaramnes. His son was
Arsames, who was the father of Hystaspes, the cousin
of Cambyses.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> When the older line became extinct
in Cambyses, the younger should have ascended the
throne in the person of their head Hystaspes, but the
Magians usurped it. What could be more natural than
that Hystaspes and Darius should take the lead in
overthrowing the usurper, and winning back the crown
which had been taken from them. As the future
head of the tribe of the Pasargadae, the future heir to
the throne takes the lead, and we may find in his six
associates the remaining six tribes of the Persians.
We know that they had the privilege of marriage
with the house of Ach&aelig;menes, and of free entry
to the king; the tribal princes also wore the upright
<i>kidaris</i>, like the king (V. 328). Hence Darius could
say in Herodotus: "Who will refuse entrance to us,
the chiefs of the Persians?<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>" And any one who should
do so "would at once show himself to be their
enemy;" hence, as Herodotus relates, the seven, by
divine guidance, arrived at the palace.</p>

<p>Thus far does tradition carry us; but the inscriptions
of Darius enable us to go a good step farther.
"The dominion, which Gaumata the Magian took
from Cambyses, belonged of old to our family," so
king Darius tells us. "My father was Vista&ccedil;pa,
the father of Vista&ccedil;pa was Arsama, the father of
Arsama was Ariyaramna, the father of Ariyaramna was
Chaispis, and the father of Chaispis was Hakhamanis.
This Gaumata lied. He said: I am Bardiya, the son
of Kurus; I am king. There was no one, either Mede
or Persian, or of our family, who had taken the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
dominion from Gaumata the Magian.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The people
feared him; he put to death many people who had
known Bardiya, to prevent its being known that he
was not Bardiya the son of Kurus. No one made any
attempt against Gaumata the Magian, till I came.
Then I called Auramazda to my aid; and Auramazda
assisted me. There is a citadel, &Ccedil;ikathauvatis by
name, in the land of Ni&ccedil;aya in Media; there with
men devoted to me I slew Gaumata the Magian and
his chief adherents. This was in the month Bagayadis,
on the tenth day. I slew him, and took from him
the dominion. By the grace of Auramazda I became
king. Auramazda transferred the kingdom to me; I
restored the dominion which was taken from our
tribe. The places of worship (the houses of the gods
in the Babylonian version) which Gaumata the Magian
destroyed, these I preserved for the people. I gave
back to the families what Gaumata had taken from
them. What had been carried away I placed where
it had been before. By the grace of Auramazda I
did this. I laboured till I placed this race of ours
again in its position. As it was before, as though
Gaumata the Magian had not robbed our family, so I
arranged it again.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> These are the men who were
present at the time when I slew Gaumata the Magian,
who called himself Bardiya; these men helped me at
that time as my adherents: Vindafrana (Intaphernes
in Herodotus), the son of Vaya&ccedil;para, a Persian;
Utana (Otanes), the son of Thukhra, a Persian;
Gaubaruva (Gobryas), the son of Marduniya (Mardonius),
a Persian; Vidarna (Hydarnes), the son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Bagabigna, a Persian; Bagabukhsa (Megabyzus), the
son of Daduhya, a Persian; Ardumanis, the son of
Vahuka (Ochus), a Persian."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>As has been shown, Gaumata had seized the
dominion on Persian ground. He had first shown
himself to the Persians as their master: "He caused
Persia to revolt," is the recapitulation in the inscription
of Behistun. The statement of Herodotus that
he remitted for a certain period the tribute, which
the provinces had to furnish yearly in the form of
presents, and announced that for some years to come
they need not expect anything from distant wars,
cannot be called in question. He had every reason
to make his rule acceptable, and the treasures of
Cyrus at Pasargadae were no doubt still large enough
to enable him to dispense with the tribute for some
years.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The inscription of Darius and the tablets
at Babylon (p. 195), establish the fact that not the
satraps only, whom Cyrus and Cambyses had set
up, and the population of the subject lands, but
even the army of Cambyses which had gone with
him to Egypt and returned after his death, recognized
the Magian as king. As Herodotus says, Gaumata
succeeded so that all nations wished his reign back
when he had fallen, except the Persians. Most
remarkable is the passage in the inscription of Darius
according to which Gaumata had destroyed the places
of worship or the houses of the gods. How could a
man, who claimed to be the son of Cyrus, begin by
attacking the existing mode of worship, which Cyrus
had practised and protected, without annihilating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
himself? Or was it the Magian tendency in him,
which sought to bring the stricter forms observed
by the priests into universal observance, and establish
uniformity of worship? Or does Darius merely mean
that Gaumata had allowed the temples of the subject
nations to fall into ruin (Cyrus and Darius took them
under their care). This is probably the meaning of the
obscure passage in the Persian text; the Babylonian
version shows that temples of the gods are spoken
of, and these the Persians and Medes did not possess.</p>

<p>The murder of Smerdis cannot have remained an
entire secret. The murderer or murderers knew it,
and the relatives, the members of the house of
Ach&aelig;menes, the servants and women, cannot have
been deceived by the resemblance for any length of
time. The narrative of Darius tells us plainly, "that
Gaumata put to death many men in order that it
might not be known that he was not the son of Cyrus."
There is no doubt that Cambyses, when dying,
acknowledged his deed, but only to the Ach&aelig;menids
and the six tribal princes. Darius was with Cambyses
in Egypt. From Herodotus we learn that he secretly
sent messages to the satraps at the time of the rule
of the Magians<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. Hence he knew of the fact, and,
as was fitting, he urged the overthrow of the Magian
before all others. Why the younger line of the royal
house and the tribal princes of the Persians did not
come forward immediately after the death of Cambyses&mdash;why
they did not call on the Persians to rise
against the Magians&mdash;on these matters we can only
make conjectures, which however are of a suggestive
kind. One obvious reason was that the declaration
that the throne had been usurped, and the rising
of the Persians which would have followed such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
a declaration, would have thrown the kingdom into
the most violent convulsions. This would have given
the subject nations the choice of taking up arms for
their favourite, the usurper, or for their own independence;
it would have given them the right, and
the Medes above all, of throwing off the existing
rule. Could they venture to renew the dangerous
war, which Cyrus had waged against the Medes,
which had been so long undecided, and had brought
the Persians into the greatest distress, in which
they had conquered only after the most severe
efforts? Who would guarantee a happy issue to the
new conflict? And if the Medes were really conquered
for the second time, would not the conflict
with them be the signal for the other nations to
revolt on their part also? In this way the kingdom
of Cyrus would be completely disorganized. Thus
Hystaspes and Darius and the princes of the Persians
hesitated; and contented themselves with coming to
a secret understanding with the satraps. So long as
the royal house and the six princes remained silent,
the pretended son of Cyrus was compelled to spare
the Ach&aelig;menids and the tribal princes in order to
play his own part, but their silence on the other hand
declared the Magian to be the legitimate ruler, and
the longer that they were silent the more securely
did they establish his throne. This position of affairs
was the more difficult for the Ach&aelig;menids, because
Gaumata, as we are told in the inscription, removed
his residence from Persia to Media. He was aware
no doubt that his deception could not be long maintained
against the Persians and the satraps. In
Media, therefore, he was more secure than in Persia,
for in Media the Magians formed a numerous and
exclusive order. If the Persians rose against him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
his best support against them was the Medes; if the
deception had to be dropped, the rising of the
Persians would pass into a war between the Persians
and Medes.</p>

<p>From the important position which the authority
of Herodotus assigns to Otanes, and the peculiar
honours subsequently paid to him and his family,
we may perhaps assume that it was he more than
any other, who, with the fixed resolution not to
endure the dominion of Gaumata, pointed out at
the same time the unavoidable consequences of an
armed rising of Persia. Instead of shattering the
central power with their own hands, he must have
advised his confederates to get it into their own
power, and with this object in view he proposed the
removal of the Magian, the surprise, and assassination
in the citadel. There would be time for an open
conflict if the assassination failed. Darius, who was
then about thirty-five,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> was younger and more hasty;
he may have insisted on a sudden decision and have
been more inclined to use open violence. Finally,
the princes of the Persians united with Darius in the
attempt to assassinate the king. It is obvious that
the consultations and deliberations which led to this
resolution took place among few, and in the greatest
secrecy. It was necessary to avoid observation and
suspicion; they must not go in a company. The son
of Hystaspes might take a message from his father to
the king, and the chiefs of the Persian tribes might
accompany him. They were the chosen councillors
of the king, and had the right of free entry to him.
Ought they to despair of this because they had not
been summoned to the council? If they had had
confederates in the palace of Gaumata, as Ctesias<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
suggests, it would have been the most foolish rashness
to go to Media in such small numbers. That Darius
accomplished the deed with six associates only, as
he himself tells us, proves that they could reckon
on obtaining an entrance for these seven only, and
that the king dared not refuse it to them. His false
assertion that he was an Ach&aelig;menid, and the king
of the Persians, must have been his ruin; it compelled
him to admit the seven; at any rate the guards of
the palace had no orders to the contrary. The upright
tiara, which the Persian kings, the descendants
of Ach&aelig;menes, and the princes of the remaining six
tribes wore, and which Plutarch suggests was the
mark of recognition among the conspirators (Polyaenus
states this for a fact<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>), pointed out Darius
and his associates to the body-guard as having the
right of free entrance. It was not, as the Greeks
thought, a mark of distinction given to the six after
the deed, but, as we have seen, a distinction which
they possessed, along with others, from the time of
Ach&aelig;menes, and the arrangement of the Persian constitution.
The six princes of the Persians, and at their
head the eldest son of the lawful successor to the
throne, Hystaspes the prince of the seventh tribe, or
Pasargadae, were resolved to attack the pretended
king in his palace in Media, and risk their lives to
maintain the throne in the hands of the Persians.
We must look for the citadel of &Ccedil;ikathauvatis in
Ni&ccedil;aya between Kermanshah and Elvend, at the
southern foot of the mountain overlooking the pastures
of the Nis&aelig;an horses. If the attempt failed Darius
and his companions could hardly escape. But the
father of Darius and two younger brothers (Artabanus
and Artaphernes) were alive and in safety. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
could avenge the fall of the conspirators, and by
taking up the struggle openly, attempt to succeed
where craft had failed. In the struggle, as in the
previous consultation, the source from which Herodotus
has drawn represents Gobryas as the leading
person next to Darius. He is the first whom Otanes
admits to the secret; he always votes with Darius for
immediate action; he seizes one of the two Magians&mdash;obviously
the king himself&mdash;whom Darius then
slays. Gobryas was the chief of the Pateischoreans,
who dwelt next to the Pasargadae on Lake Bakhtegan,
and the father-in-law of Darius, to whom his daughter
had already borne three sons.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The bold resolution to attack the usurper in the
midst of Media and cut him down with his adherents
in his palace succeeded. If Herodotus tells us that
when the princes after the assassination called the
Persians together, and showed them the heads of the
Magians, the Persians also drew their swords and
slew all the Magians who came in their way, the truth
is that the only Persians before the citadel of &Ccedil;ikathauvatis
in the Median district of Nisaea would be
the servants of the Persians who accompanied them
there. The question was not the slaughter of the
Magi; such a massacre would have been the most
foolish thing that could have been done. The Persians
who attended the princes had no other duty than to
enable their masters to escape from the citadel in case
of failure, and in case of success to prevent the servants
of Gaumata, who may very likely have been for the
most part Magians, from dispersing, and to cut them
down, to avail themselves of the overthrow of the
guard in order to disarm them. The supposed
slaughter of the Magians has arisen from the festival,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
by which the Persians celebrated the day of the
assassination of the Magian, the tenth of Bagayadis.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Five days after the death of the Magian the seven
took counsel together, as Herodotus relates, on the
state of affairs. Otanes was of opinion that the
government should be handed over to the whole body
of the Persians, that it was not well that one should
rule over them. Megabyzus represented oligarchy;
the best men should form the best resolutions.
Darius spoke in favour of monarchy. In an oligarchy
enmities arise, and out of enmities rebellions and
struggles, which lead to monarchy. In democracy
baseness forces its way in, and the base gather together
till a man arises who can reduce them to
order; he is then admired by the people and raised to
be their ruler. A man had given freedom to the
Persians, and it was not well to set aside the laws of
the fathers. Then Otanes said: "Fellow-conspirators,
it is obvious that one of us will be king, as we are
leaving the choice to the Persians either by lot or in
some other manner. But I do not seek the throne
with you: I wish neither to be a ruler, nor to be
ruled over. I leave the dominion to you on the condition
that neither I nor my descendants shall be
subjects to you." The six agreed, and Otanes remained
apart; to this day his family is the only free family
in Persia, and is governed only so much as it pleases,
provided that it does not transgress the laws of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Persians. The others resolved, that if the monarchy
came to one of them, Otanes and his descendants
should each year receive a Median robe and the gifts
of highest honour usual among the Persians, because
he had been the first to entertain the idea and had
called them together. For the whole seven they resolved
that each should have the right of entering the
palace without announcement, whenever he would,
and the king should not be allowed to take a wife
from any but the families of the conspirators. The
throne was to go to the man whose horse, when in the
suburbs of the city, should be the first to neigh at the
rising of the sun. In the night Oebares, the groom of
Darius, led his horse along the road, on which the
six would ride in the morning, to a mare which he
had previously caused to be brought there. When
the princes rode out next morning, as had been agreed
upon, the horse of Darius neighed at the place where
the mare had been brought to him in the night, and
at the same moment there was thunder and lightning
in a clear sky. Then the five sprang from their
horses and did homage to Darius. And when Darius
was established on his throne, he set up a picture in
relief on stone representing a man with a horse, and
underneath it he engraved the words: "Darius, the
son of Hystaspes, by the help of his horse and his
groom Oebares, came to be king over the Persians."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>In Pompeius Trogus we are told: "The conspirators
were so equal in valour and noble birth, that it was
difficult for the people to elect one of them to be king.
But the conspirators themselves devised an expedient
which left the decision to religion and good luck.
They resolved to ride early in the morning to a
particular place before the citadel; and he whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
horse was the first to neigh at the rising of the sun,
was to be king. For the Persians regarded the sun as
the only deity, and horses as sacred to him. Among
the conspirators was Darius the son of Hystaspes."
After narrating the trick of the groom in the same
manner as Herodotus, our excerpt continues: "The
moderation of the others was so great that when they
had received the sign from the gods (Justin speaks
only of the neighing, not of the thunder and lightning),
they at once sprang from their horses and
greeted Darius as king. The whole people followed
the decision of the princes and made him their king.
By such a trivial circumstance did the monarchy of
the Persians, which was won by the valour of the
seven noblest men, come into the hands of one person.
It is extraordinary that those who risked their lives
to wrest the throne from the Magians, should have
resigned it with such readiness, though it is true that
in addition to the nobility of form, and the valour,
which made Darius worthy of the throne, he was
also related by blood to the ancient kings."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The
excerpt from the account of Ctesias tells us: "Sphendadates
(p. 208 ff.) had reigned seven months (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> after
the death of Cambyses). Of the seven Darius became
king because his horse first neighed at the rising of
the sun, which was the sign agreed upon among them;
but it was induced to neigh by a certain trick and
stratagem. Since then the Persians celebrate the
slaughter of the Magians on the day on which
Sphendadates the Magian was slain."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>An election to the throne was not a matter of
necessity after the fall of the Magian. The older
line of the royal house, the descendants of the elder
son of Teispes, had become extinct with Smerdis and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Cambyses; the younger line had the right to ascend
the throne. The head of this line was Hystaspes. We
not only learn from Herodotus, that he was still alive,
the inscription of Behistun mentions his achievements
after his son ascended the throne. The father
gave place to the son, just as the father of Cyrus had
given place to his son in the rise of the Persians
against Astyages. Hystaspes abandoned the throne in
favour of his eldest son. This renunciation, in case of
success, must have taken place before Darius set out
to Media, when the son went with the princes of the
Persians to succeed in the work of liberation or to
perish. These princes were in a position to salute
Darius as king immediately after the fall of the
Magian. A sign from the gods could only be required
to show that the son would be accepted in the place
of the father. It was more important to prove to the
Medians, the inhabitants of Nisaea, that the new ruler
who took the place of the murdered prince had done
so with the will of the gods, that Darius had seized
the crown with the will of Auramazda and Mithra.
We know the sacred horses and chariot which the
Persians kept for the god of the sun and of light.
The lucky neighing with which the horse on which
the new king was mounted greeted the rising of the
sun on the seventh day after the death of the Magian,
put it beyond doubt that the act was just, that the
new ruler of Persia was under the protection of the
far-seeing Mithra, the god of truth, the destroyer of
lies. The narrative of the trick of Oebares is no
doubt a Greek invention. In the mind of the Persians
it would have deprived the divine signal of any importance.
In the narrative of Herodotus it is quite
superfluous, for not only does the horse neigh but
thunder and lightning occur in a clear sky. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
name of the groom, Oebares, does not improve the
story or make it more credible; it is merely a
repetition of the name of that most faithful and
energetic counsellor and helper of Cyrus, who first,
himself a fortunate omen, meets him in the foreign
country, and carries horsedung towards him, and
afterwards assists him to victory and the throne
(V. 346). As regards the equestrian picture, which,
according to Herodotus, Darius set up in honour of
his horse and his groom, Darius had certainly no
interest in announcing to the kingdom that he had
won the throne by deception. No doubt Darius left
splendid monuments behind him. He may also have
caused the divine consecration and confirmation of his
kingdom to be engraved upon a rock, but the inscription
to the picture certainly did not mention the
deception, or the inventor of it and his service.</p>

<p>Herodotus represents the conspirators as consulting
about the best form of government on the sixth day
after the assassination, no doubt because the opinion
existed among the Greeks, that the Persians had a
custom by which anarchy was allowed to prevail for
five days after the death of the king, not as a sign
of mourning, but in order to learn by experience
what an evil anarchy was.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The best form of government
might be discussed in Hellas, but it could not
be discussed in Persia, and least of all in the citadel
of &Ccedil;ikathauvatis. Herodotus himself observes, that
these speeches were incredible to some of the Greeks,
but that nevertheless they were made;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> he even recurs
to the subject, supporting the story on the fact that
Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, had removed the
tyrants from the cities of the Ionians and set up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
democracies there. Herodotus exaggerates what was
done in the year 493 <small>B.C.</small> in order to support his story
of this discussion; if Mardonius established democracies,
Otanes may have represented this form of
constitution in the council of the seven. At that
time tyrannies were not preserved in the Greek
cities to the extent that the princes of Miletus,
Histiaeus and Aristagoras, raised the sign of rebellion
for the Ionians on purely personal grounds. Hence
after the rebellion had been crushed, tyrannies were
not fully restored in these cities. But the tyrants
who remained faithful to Persia, like Aeaces of
Lesbos, and Strattis of Chios, were replaced on their
thrones. Strattis was ruler of Lesbos in the time of
Xerxes. Even after Mardonius had visited the coast
of Anatolia, Hippoclus and Aeantides ruled over
Lampsacus; the Pisistratid&aelig; in Sigeum; Demaratus
obtained Teuthrania, Halisarna, and Pergamum; Gongylus,
Gambrion, Myrina, and Gryneum; Theomestor
in the reign of Xerxes was tyrant of Samos; in
Herodotus' own city the descendants of Lygdamis
retained the throne. To renew the tyrannies in their
old extent, when they were intended to keep in subjection
Greek maritime cities of considerable power
without Persian garrisons was not necessary after
these cities had been so greatly weakened by the
suppression of the rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The legend of the discussion of the seven as to the
best form of constitution has grown up out of the
privileges of the six tribal princes, who as a fact
formed an aristocratic element in the Persian constitution
(V. 329), and out of the peculiar immunities
enjoyed by the house of Otanes; the Greeks traced
both one and the other back to the assassination of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the Magians. From the immunities, and supposed self-government
of this house, the Greeks concluded that
Otanes must at that time have pronounced for the
freedom and self-government of the Persians, and
Herodotus represents him as consistently democratic,
and taking no part in the election to the throne. In
the discussion the defence of monarchy was naturally
assigned to the future occupant of the throne.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE REBELLIONS IN THE PROVINCES.</h3>


<p>One of the boldest deeds known to history had been
accomplished, one of the most marvellous complications
had been severed by a remarkable venture.
At a distance from their home and people, six
Persians, led by a prince of the royal house, had
attacked and cut down the pretended son of Cyrus,
in his fortified citadel, when surrounded by his
adherents, after he had reigned for more than ten
months (Spring 521 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>). An Ach&aelig;menid again
sat on the throne of Cyrus. Whether the removal
of the usurper and the sudden proclamation of Darius
on the soil of Media had really prevented the ruin
of the kingdom, as it was intended to do, and
whether it would produce the results which the
Ach&aelig;menids and the princes of the Persians expected
from it, was a question, which, in spite of the success,
still remained to be settled. It was true that the
resumption of the struggle with the Medes for the
sovereignty was for the moment avoided, but that
the accession of Darius brought the whole kingdom
into obedience to his power had still to be shown.
Undeniable facts prove that even in the last years
of Cambyses the bonds of obedience were relaxed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
The satraps of the provinces had been able to rule
over their provinces independently. This had been
rapidly followed by two violent changes in the succession,
which seemed to promise success to further usurpation.
The various nations were quite satisfied with
the rule of Gaumata. Their favourite chief had been
slain; they were now called upon to obey his assassin,
whose reign betokened the return of the severer rule.
Neither in Media nor in Babylon did men forget
the state of affairs before Cyrus; scarcely eighteen
years had elapsed since Babylon had been taken
by Cyrus. The nations of the kingdom were in
agitation.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Elated by the success of his venture, in the full
vigour of his life,&mdash;according to Herodotus Darius
had scarcely reached the thirtieth year, and according
to Ctesias the thirty-sixth year of his age,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>&mdash;the new
ruler seemed equal even to the heaviest tasks. The
boldness of his resolution, the daring nature of the
advice which he had given, were favourable indications
that he possessed the power to keep the kingdom of
Cyrus together. While he could not but direct his
gaze in the most eager expectation to the nations of
the empire, he found in his immediate proximity,
among the associates in the deed of &Ccedil;ikathauvatis,
an independent and rebellious spirit. A remarkable
indication proved that the princes of the Persian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
tribes, to whose devotion he owed the throne, who
had risked as much as himself, were for that very
reason inclined to regard themselves as more on an
equality with the new king, and to pay less respect
to his authority. Soon after the assassination of the
Magian, Intaphernes, one of the six Persian princes,
who had lost an eye in the conflict with the Magians,
came one day into the palace to speak with the king.
But the doorkeepers and servants would not admit
him because the king was with one of his wives.
Intaphernes thought that this statement was false, and
that the new king intended to refuse to the Persian
princes the ancient right of free entry; he drew his
sword, cut off the ears and noses of each of the two
servants, strung them on the reins of his bridle and
hung them round their necks. In this act of violence
Darius could only see extreme contempt for the royal
dignity, and the most severe outrage of it in the
persons of his servants; he was convinced that it
was the announcement of a rebellion. He did not
venture to step in and punish at once; he could
hardly assume that Intaphernes would have done such
an action without an understanding with the other
chieftains; they had intended, no doubt, to humble
the king, and now that they had helped him to the
throne, they wished to take up a different position
towards the ruler whom they had raised from that
which they had occupied towards Cyrus and Cambyses.
It was not till Darius had questioned each
of the princes separately, and ascertained that Intaphernes
had acted independently, that he caused him
to be thrown into prison with his sons and all his
family. He desired, no doubt, on this first opportunity
to show the chiefs of the Persians their master, and
his intention was naturally carried out with oriental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
cruelty. Regardless of the services of Intaphernes
and the wound which he had received, he was to
be executed and all the males of his house with him;
the entire stock of this princely family was to be
annihilated. The entreaties of the wife of Intaphernes
only prevailed so far as to save from death her
brother and her eldest son, so that the race could
at least be kept in existence.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Still more dangerous, though at a greater distance,
appeared to be the attitude of a satrap who ruled
over wide regions. Oroetes had been made satrap
of Lydia and Ionia by Cyrus. In the last year of
Cambyses he had enticed Polycrates of Samos to
Magnesia into his power, and had caused him to be
executed there, in order to bring about the subjugation
of Samos. When called upon by Darius to
declare against Gaumata he had paid no heed to
the command, but had availed himself of the confusion
to assassinate Mitrobates the satrap of Phrygia, who
resided at Dascyleum, and possess himself of that
satrapy. He now ruled from Sardis to the Halys.
After the accession of Darius, so far from obeying
his commands to appear at the court, he cut down
the messenger who brought them. It was obviously
his intention to establish an independent kingdom
in Asia Minor. It did not appear possible to crush
him without an open struggle, and the beginning
of this would be a signal of revolt for many others.
Darius summoned the chief of the Persians, and
asked if any one could remove Oroetes out of the
way. In the narrative of Herodotus not one only
but thirty offered themselves for the venture. They
cast lots, and the lot fell on Bagaeus the son of
Artontes. Provided with the necessary letters from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the king, he went as an extraordinary commissioner
to Sardis. The garrison of the citadel at Sardis in
which Oroetes resided consisted of a thousand Persian
lance-bearers. Bagaeus caused a communication from
Darius to be read to these troops in the presence of
Oroetes. They showed respect for the letter and
the royal seal, and expressed a willingness to obey
the king's commands. As soon as Bagaeus had convinced
himself of their feeling, he read an order
from Darius in which the lance-bearers were forbidden
to obey Oroetes any longer. They at once placed
their lances on the ground. Encouraged by this,
Bagaeus immediately read the last order, in which
Darius bade the Persians at Sardis to put Oroetes to
death. This command also was executed on the spot.
It was a rapid success, and an extremely fortunate
event for Darius. Asia Minor from the Halys to the
Aegean was brought under his authority at a single
blow.</p>

<p>Herodotus only remarks in passing, that the Medes
revolted from Darius, but were conquered in the battle
and reduced again to submission.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He relates the
rebellion of the Babylonians at greater length. Since
the accession of the Magian the Babylonians had
secretly prepared to throw off the yoke of Persia.
They put to death all the women in the city who were
not mothers, leaving only a childless wife and another
woman in each household, that their provisions might
not fail, and when Darius brought up his forces, and
invested Babylon, they made merry over the siege and
danced behind their towers. A whole year and seven
months passed away, and Darius tried every art and
invention in vain, including the means by which Cyrus
had taken the city and many others, but the Babylonians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
were strongly on their guard, and it was impossible to
take the city. In the twentieth month, Zopyrus the
son of Megabyzus, one of the men who had taken part
in the assassination of the Magian, appeared before
the throne of Darius with his nose and ears cut off, his
hair shaved, and his body covered with blows from a
whip. Distressed to see one of the most distinguished
men in such a condition, the king sprang up and
asked who had done him such an irreparable injury. It
was intolerable, Zopyrus answered, that the Assyrians
should mock the Persians any longer; he had not
acquainted the king with his design that he might not
prevent him from carrying it out. It was his intention
in this plight to seek admittance into the city
and to tell the Babylonians that the king of the
Persians had treated him thus. He thought that
they would believe him, and entrust him with the
command over a division. On the tenth day after his
reception into the city, Darius was to place a thousand
men of the troops which he valued least against
the gate of Semiramis; on the seventeenth two
thousand against the gate of Ninus; on the thirty-seventh
four thousand against the gate of the Chald&aelig;ans.
If he achieved great successes against these
troops the Babylonians would no doubt entrust everything
to him, even the keys of their gates. Then
Darius was to attack the city on all sides, and place
the Persians against the gates of Belus and the gate
of the Cissians. "Zopyrus set forth, gave his name
at the gate, pretended to be a deserter, and demanded
entrance. The guards led him before the council of
the city. He lamented the treatment which he had
received from Darius because he had advised him to
lead away his army, inasmuch as there was no way of
taking the city. He could do them the greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
services, and Darius and the Persians the greatest
harm, for he knew their plans in every direction.
The Babylonians seeing the most distinguished Persian
without nose or ears, covered with stripes and blood,
listened to his words, and believed that he had come
to aid them; and they were ready at his request to
allow him the command of a division." At the head
of his Babylonian soldiers Zopyrus cut down the three
troops on the days agreed upon. "Then Zopyrus
was all in all to the Babylonians; they elected him
general and keeper of the walls of the city, and when
Darius, as had been agreed upon, stormed the city on
every side, and the besieged repulsed their opponents
in every direction, Zopyrus opened the Cissian gate
and the gate of Belus to the Persians and brought
them into the city. The Babylonians who saw this
fled into the shrine of Belus, but the others fought on
in their ranks till they perceived that they had been
betrayed. Thus Babylon was recovered, and Darius
now did what Cyrus had neglected to do at the time
of his conquest; he destroyed the walls, tore down
the gates, impaled nearly three thousand of the leading
men, and gave the city to the remainder for a
habitation. In order that they might have wives and
posterity, Darius commanded each of the neighbouring
nations to send a number of women to Babylon; in all
there were 50,000, and from these the present inhabitants
of the city are descended. In the judgment of
Darius no one had ever done greater service to the
Persians than Zopyrus, with the exception of Cyrus,
with whom no Persian could be compared. It is
also asserted that Darius was wont to say that he
would willingly lose twenty Babylons, if Zopyrus
might be restored from his mutilated condition. He
held him in great honour, gave him each year the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
presents which are most honourable among the Persians,
conferred on him for his life the government of
Babylon free of all tribute to the king, and a great
deal besides."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Megabyzus, the son of Daduhya, who aided Darius
in putting the Magian to death, and his descendants,
were only too well known to the Greeks, and more
especially to the Athenians. Megabyzus conquered
Perinthus, and reduced Thracia and Macedonia beneath
the Persian rule. The son of this Megabyzus
was Zopyrus, to whom Darius, according to the narrative
of Herodotus, owed the capture of Babylon; the
son of Zopyrus was Megabyzus the younger, who in
the year 455 <small>B.C.</small> inflicted on the Athenians in Egypt
one of the heaviest defeats which they ever experienced;
they lost more than 200 triremes, and nearly
the whole of the crews, for those who escaped to
Cyrene were few in number.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> From the marriage of
this Megabyzus with the daughter of Xerxes and
Amestris, the granddaughter of Otanes, sprang the
younger Zopyrus, who broke with Artaxerxes I.
after the death of his parents, retired to Athens after
440 <small>B.C.</small>, and afterwards, when attacking the city of
Caunus in Caria with Attic troops&mdash;the city belonged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
to the Attic league but had withdrawn from it, and
it was necessary to reduce it&mdash;was killed by a stone
thrown from the walls.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Hence the achievements of
the princely family, who were the forefathers of the
deserter&mdash;of his father Megabyzus, his grandfather,
the elder Zopyrus, and his great-grandfather&mdash;were
peculiarly interesting to the Greeks. The minute
account which Herodotus gives of the greatest act of
the older Zopyrus must be derived from information
which he obtained in Athens either from the younger
Zopyrus or from his retinue, and these would relate
what the minstrels of the Persians had sung of the
sacrifice made by the elder Zopyrus for the great king
and the kingdom. We can trace a poetical source in
the mocking of the besiegers, and the saying connected
with it. A Babylonian cries to the Persians, "Why do
you sit there? Why do you not retire? Ye will take
the city when mules bring forth." A mule belonging
to Zopyrus does bring forth; this sign, showing that
Babylon can be taken, determines Zopyrus to mutilate
himself, when he had previously ascertained from
Darius that the king attached the greatest importance
to the capture of the city. The massacre of the women
of the Babylonians must also be poetical. Herodotus
himself tells us that the Babylonians had prepared their
rebellion for a long time, ever since the Magian had
ascended the throne. Thus they had at least a year
before the investment of the city in which to furnish
it with provisions, and the adjacent country was most
fruitful; moreover, the walls of Babylon enclosed a
very large extent of arable and pasture land (III. 382).
We may conceive of such wholesale massacre as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
act of desperation in consequence of a long siege; but
in the account of Herodotus it took place before the
city was invested, and is one of the preparations of
the Babylonians. It is not until he has heard of the
massacre of the women that Darius sets out against
Babylon. Not less remarkable are the definite numbers
of the troops, which Zopyrus with the Babylonians
cuts down on the appointed days. The names of the
five gates mentioned in the narrative seem to show
exact local knowledge. But though a gate in Babylon
might be named after Belus, and another "the gate
of Elam" (the Cissians); no gate in that city could
have been named after the Chald&aelig;ans, or Ninus, or
Semiramis. So far as the inscriptions of Babylon have
been deciphered, the names of the gates were different.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
As the forms of Ninus and Semiramis and
their history do not belong even in the remotest
degree to Babylonia and her history, but are rather
shown to be inventions of the Medo-Persian Epos,
these two gates which are named after them point
to the Persian source from which the narrative of
Herodotus was derived. More incredible even than
the massacre of the women at the beginning of the
rebellion is their replacement after the capture by the
50,000 women whom Darius causes the neighbouring
nations to send to Babylon. Darius had no reasons for
assisting a city which had maintained itself against
him for more than twenty months, the walls and gates
of which he had broken, and at the same time, as
Herodotus himself tells us, had executed the leading
men, 3000 in number, by a cruel death. His interests
lay in precisely the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Darius himself informs us about the rising of the
Babylonians and their subjugation. "When I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
slain Gaumata, there was a man Atrina, by name,
the son of Upadarma, who rebelled in Susiana. He
said to the people: 'I am king in Susiana.' Then the
inhabitants in Susiana became rebellious; they went
over to Atrina; he was king in Susiana. Moreover
there was a man of Babylon, Naditabira by name
(Nidintabel in the Babylonian text), the son of Aniri;
he rebelled in Babylon. He deceived the people thus:
'I am Nabukadrachara (Nabukudurussur), the son of
Nabunita.' Then the people of Babylon went over
entirely to Naditabira; he seized the throne in
Babylon. After this I sent (an army?) to Susiana;
Atrina was brought in fetters before me; I slew him.
Then I marched to Babylonia against Naditabira,
who called himself Nabukadrachara. The army of
Naditabira maintained the Tigris, and occupied the
river with ships; his whole power protected the Tigris.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Auramazda came to my aid; by the grace of Auramazda
I crossed the Tigris, and severely defeated the
army of Naditabira. On the 26th of the month of
Athriyadiya (on the 26th of the month Kislev), then
it was, that we gave battle. After this I marched
against Babylon. When I went against Babylon,
there is a city, by name Zazana on the Euphrates,
there this Naditabira, who called himself Nabukadrachara,
had come with an army to give me
battle. Then we joined battle. Auramazda came
to my aid; by the grace of Auramazda I severely
defeated the army of Naditabira. The enemy was
driven into the water; the water carried him away;<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
on the second day of the month of Anamaka, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
we joined battle. Then Naditabira went with a few
horse to Babylon, and I went to Babylon. By the
grace of Auramazda I took Babylon and captured
Naditabira. Then I slew Naditabira at Babylon.
While I was in Babylonia these provinces revolted:
Persia, Susiana, Media, Assyria, Parthia, Margiana,
the Sattagyd&aelig;, the Sac&aelig;."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The inscription shows that the inhabitants of Elam
gave the signal for revolt, that their leader Atrina
attempted to raise once more that ancient kingdom
125 years after its fall. Nabonetus (Nabunahed,
Nabunita), the last king of Babylon, had been sent
by Cyrus to Carmania and had died there (p. 89).
A man, who gave himself out to be his younger son,
took the lead of the Babylonians, and once more
called into existence the revered name of Nebuchadnezzar.
He had time to collect an army, and considered
himself strong enough to meet the Persians
in the open field. On the eastern border of the
ancient kingdom, on the Tigris, he awaited the attack
of the Persians; he brings armed ships to the place,
that they may facilitate his defence of the right bank,
and make it difficult for the enemy to cross the river.
The Elamites were overpowered, their leader captured
and slain. The heavier task of reducing Babylon
was undertaken by Darius himself. The army which
he led was obviously the same as that which conquered
Susiana; it consisted of Persians and Medes,
as is shown by the sequel of the inscription. Darius
had to open the campaign against the new Nebuchadnezzar
in the same manner in which Cyrus nineteen
years previously had begun his war against Nabonetus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
He had first to cross the Tigris. This was done,
and Nebuchadnezzar retired in a slanting direction
across Babylonia to the Euphrates, closely pursued
by Darius. On the Euphrates he was again defeated,
and his people were driven in part into the river, but
he was not cut off from the city as Nabonetus had
been by Cyrus; he was able to reach the protection
of the walls of Babylon. We know their powers of
resistance. The Persians had crossed the Tigris at
a place where it is not more than 100 miles distant
from the Euphrates, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> not far below the Median
walls; for the battle on the Tigris was fought on the
26th (or 27th) of Athriadiya, and six days after, on
the 2nd of Anamaka, the Babylonian army suffered
its second defeat on the bank of the Euphrates at
Zazana. As Athriadiya coincides with the Kislev
(November-December) and Anamaka with the Tebet
(December-January) of the Babylonians (p. 195), the
rebellion of Babylonia must have taken place in the
summer and the investment of the city in the last
weeks of the year 521 <small>B.C.</small> The inscriptions tell us
nothing of the length of the siege. On the other
hand we have five tablets from the reign of the rebel,
Nebuchadnezzar III., all dated from Babylon, and
bearing the name of the same witness. They date,
in the time of this king, from Kislev 20, to the next
Tisri and Marchesvan, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from November-December
of the year of the battles down to October-November
of the next year.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The inscription of Behistun allows
that all the central lands of the kingdom, not excepting
Persia, rebelled against Darius during the siege.
It follows therefore that success at Babylon was long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
enough delayed to awake the hope that Darius would
be checked before Babylonia, and defeated there.
The twenty months of Herodotus would carry us
from the end of the year 521 <small>B.C.</small> to the autumn of
the year 519 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The rebellion made head everywhere. In spite of
the day of &Ccedil;ikathauvatis, the kingdom was going
to ruin. The position of Darius was desperate. The
longer the siege, the more fixed the belief that he
could not succeed, the greater was the progress of the
revolt. If he raised the siege to turn against the
rebels, that was a proof that he could not conquer
Babylon; the confidence of the rebels in their fortunes
would be increased, and the army discouraged
with which he had conquered on the Tigris and the
Euphrates, with which he stood in personal relations,
and which he had drawn into close connection with himself.
On this army the kingdom rested; it remained yet
loyal in the camp at Babylon. The deed in Nisaea had
been best confirmed by the fact that Media recognized
Darius as king, that he had been able to summon the
Median contingent to the field, and by his successes to
connect the Median army with himself. "The Persian
and Median army which was with me remained faithful;
the Median nations which remained at home,
revolted"&mdash;so we learn from the inscription.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Darius
perceived that he must not weaken the only support
which he had in this difficult crisis, or remove it by
his own act. He judged the situation correctly, and
remained before Babylon in spite of bad news which
was brought to him from all sides. But the resistance
was not less stubborn than the attack. It seemed
as though the new reign of Darius must come to an
end before Babylon. Could it continue beside the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
defection of the Medes, Parthians, Hyrcanians, Margiani,
Sagartians and Sattagyd&aelig;, the Armenians, Assyrians,
and Susiani, the rebellion of the Persians themselves?
Was it possible to check the outbreak of the storm of
ruin in the face of the indomitable resistance of
Babylon? Only in the distant east and west were
there glimpses of light. The satraps of Arachosia and
Bactria, Vivana and Dadarshis, remained loyal to
Darius and kept their lands in obedience. Asia Minor
was quiet; if Darius had not succeeded in removing
Oroetes at the right moment, these regions also would
have taken up arms against Darius either under him
or under some native ruler.</p>

<p>The account of Darius allows us to see that the
recently-subdued Susiani were the first to rebel when
Darius was delayed at Babylon. After them the
Medes rebelled, in order to renew the struggle for
the sovereignty between Persia and Media; this was
followed in the east by the rebellion of the Sattagyd&aelig;,
the Parthians, the Hyrcanians, the Margiani, the
Sac&aelig;; in the west the Armenians and Syrians took
up arms. Finally, even the Persians held out a hand
to the subject nations for the overthrow of the kingdom
and their own dominion. Vahyazdata, a Persian
of the tribe of the Utians (V. 323), declared himself to
be the legitimate ruler; the brother of Cambyses was
alive; he was no other than Bardiya, the son of Cyrus.
The Persians believe him; this second pretender finds
many adherents.</p>

<p>The inscription is as follows: "There was a man,
by name Martiya; he dwelt in the city of Kuganaka
in Persia; he revolted in Susiana; and said to the
people: 'I am Ymani, king in Susiana.' There was a
man, Fravartis (Phraortes) by name, a Mede. He
revolted in Media, and said: 'I am Khsathrita of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
family of Uvakhshathra' (Cyaxares). The Median
nation then became rebellious towards me; they went
over to Fravartis; and he was king in Media. Thereupon
I sent an army. I made Vidarna, a Persian,
my servant, the general, and said to them: 'Go down
and smite the Median army which does not call itself
mine.' Then Vidarna marched out. When he came
to Media, he fought a battle with the Medes at
Marus, a city in Media. By the grace of Auramazda
the army of Vidarna conquered that rebellious army on
the (twenty-seventh) day of the month Anamaka (of
the month Tebet).<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> There was a district Campada
(Cambadene) in Media; there my army awaited me.
The Parthians and Hyrcanians became rebellious to
me, and joined Fravartis. Vista&ccedil;pa, my father, was
in Parthia; the people left him and revolted. Then
Vista&ccedil;pa took those who adhered to him and marched
against the rebels. On the 22nd day of the month
Viyakhna Vista&ccedil;pa, by the grace of Auramazda,
defeated the rebels near the city of Vi&ccedil;pauvatis in
Parthia. I sent my servant, Dadarshis by name, an
Armenian, to Armenia. When he came to Armenia,
the rebels gathered together and marched against
Dadarshis to give battle. By the grace of Auramazda
my army defeated the revolted army near
Zuza in Armenia, on the 6th day of the month of
Thuravahara. The rebels marched against Dadarshis
a second time. Near the fortress of Tigra in Armenia
on the 18th of Thuravahara my army defeated the
rebellious army; they slew 526 of them, and took
520 prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> A third time the rebels marched
against Dadarshis. Near the fortress of Uhyama in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Armenia my army defeated the rebellious army on the
9th day of the month Thaigarshis. There Dadarshis
waited till I came to Media. A man, by name Chitratakhma,
revolted from me. 'I am king of Sagartia,'
he said to the people, 'of the race of Uvakhshathra'
(Cyaxares). There is a province Margiana (Margu)
by name which revolted from me. They made a man
of Margiana, Frada by name, their leader. Against
him I sent Dadarshis (Dadarsu) a Persian, my servant,
the satrap of Bactria. There was a man, Vahyazdata
by name, in the city of Tarava, in the district of
Yutiya in Persia; he said to the people: 'I am
Bardiya, the son of Kurus.' The Persian nation
revolted from me. He was king in Persia. This
Vahyazdata, who called himself Bardiya, sent an
army to Arachosia against the Persian Vivana, my
servant, the satrap of Arachosia."</p>

<p>The rebellion of Phraortes (which took place in the
summer of 520 <small>B.C.</small>) was the more dangerous because
it was undertaken with the obvious intention of
restoring the independence of Media under a scion of
the old native royal house, and the name of Cyaxares
could not but excite and give new life to national
memories among the Medes. Whatever troops Darius
could spare, and for this purpose he could only use Persians,
he sent under the command of the tribal prince
Hydarnes, his associate in the assassination of the
Magi, against the Medes, at the same time despatching
Dadarshis an Armenian to Armenia, to check the
advance of the rebellion there, and mainly, no doubt, to
prevent the alliance of the Armenians and the Medes.
A whole year after Darius had begun the investment
of Babylon, on the 27th day of Anamaka (December-January,
520 <small>B.C.</small>), Hydarnes encountered Phraortes at
Marus. He did not obtain any great success. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to content himself with maintaining against Phraortes
the district of Cambadene in the south of Media. In
the west of Media, Dadarshis had no better success
against his Armenian compatriots. When he had
fought two battles, of no great importance, if we are
to judge from the losses of the rebels in one, in one
month (on the eight and eighteenth), and a third in
May (Thaigarshis) of the year 519 <small>B.C.</small>, he was compelled
to retire to a fortress named Uhyama. In
Parthia, to the east of Media, Hystaspes the father of
Darius, who was expected to keep these regions of the
kingdom in obedience, was not in a position, with the
forces at his disposal, to prevent the defection of the
Parthians, Hyrcanians, Margiani, and Sac&aelig;. He contented
himself with the attempt to prevent the
combination of the Parthians and Hyrcanians with
Phraortes, and to limit as far as possible the spread of
the rebellion. He only succeeded in retaining a part of
the Parthians in obedience. The battle at Vi&ccedil;pauvatis
(in Viyakhna, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in March, 519), made it possible for
him to maintain himself in Parthia, but was far from
giving him the control of the land. The troops and
generals sent by Darius were not able to prevail
against the rebels; in Media and Armenia they were
reduced to the defensive, and the same was the case
with Hystaspes the father of Darius in Bactria. This
collapse of the kingdom and general rebellion was
used by a Persian of the tribe of the Utians (Yutiya<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>)
in order to win over the Persians once more with the
name of Bardiya, and to wrest them from the rule of
Darius. Vahyazdata must have found a considerable
following in Persia, and his successes must have
been important, since he could attempt to extend his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
dominion to the east over Carmania and Arachosia,
and to send an army to Arachosia in order to win
this province also from Darius.</p>

<p>The position of Darius before Babylon was hopeless.
The danger increased every day, and there
was still no prospect of winning the city. We may
certainly believe the narrative of Herodotus that
Darius left no means untried to reduce it, that he
repeated the device of drawing off the water of the
Euphrates into the basin of Sepharvaim, by which
Cyrus had attained his object twenty years previously;
the Babylonians had been taught by that
siege to be on their guard in this direction. The
account of Darius does not tell us how the city
was finally taken; he does not mention the name
of Zopyrus. The pressure of the surrounding dangers
was so great, the hope of taking the city by force
so small, that the son of a tribal king might feel
himself called upon to sacrifice himself for the king
and the kingdom, to adopt desperate measures. That
Zopyrus did take a prominent part in the capture
of Babylon is clear from the fact, which we do not
learn from Herodotus only, that the satrapy of Babylon
was given to him, and remained in his hands
during the whole reign of Darius and afterwards.
He is said to have lost his life in a rebellion of the
Babylonians in the reign of Xerxes.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> We cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
doubt that after the capture Darius proceeded with
greater severity against Babylon than Cyrus had
done, that the gates were broken and large spaces
of the walls thrown down (p. 234). The inscription
of Behistun merely mentions the execution of the
third Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>After a siege of twenty months Babylon fell in
the autumn of the year 519 <small>B.C.</small> Darius tells us
further: "Thereupon I went up from Babylon, and
marched to Media. The Susiani were overcome with
fear, they seized upon Martiya (p. 242), who was
their general, and put him to death. When I had
reached Media, there is a city, Kudurus (Kunduru)
by name, in Media, to which Fravartis marched
against me with an army. Then they gave me
battle. Auramazda came to my aid. By the grace
of Auramazda I severely defeated the army of
Fravartis on the 26th day of the month of Adukanis.
Then Fravartis with a few horsemen withdrew to
the district of Raga in Media. Then I sent an army
against them; Fravartis was captured and brought
to me. I cut off his nose, ears, and tongue. He
was kept in chains at my gate; all the people saw
him. Then I crucified him at Hangmatana (Ecbatana),
and the men who were his principal adherents
I imprisoned in the citadel of Hangmatana. Then
I sent a Persian army from Raga to Vista&ccedil;pa, and
when it had reached him, he marched out with it.
There is a city Patigrabana<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> in Parthia, there Vista&ccedil;pa
severely defeated that rebellious army on the 1st
day of the month of Garmapada; he slew 6560 of
them, and took 4182 captives. Then the land of
Parthia was mine. I sent Vaumi&ccedil;a a Persian, my
servant, to Armenia; when he came there the rebels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
collected to give battle to Vaumi&ccedil;a. At Achitu in
Assyria my army defeated the rebels on the 15th
day of Anamaka, and slew 2024 of them. A second
time they gathered together and marched against
Vaumi&ccedil;a. There is a district Antiyara (Otiara) by
name, in Armenia; there they fought on the last day
of the month of Thuravahara (Yiyar 30). By the
grace of Auramazda my army defeated the rebels
severely; they slew 2045 and took 1559 prisoners.
Against Chitratakhma (the leader of the rising of
the Sagartians), I sent a part of the Persian and
Median army.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> I made Takhma&ccedil;pada, a Mede, the
general. Takhma&ccedil;pada fought with Chitratakhma and
my army defeated the rebellious army, seized Chitratakhma,
and brought him to me. I cut off his nose
and ears, he lay in chains at my gate; all the people
saw him. Then I crucified him at Arbira (Arbela in
Assyria). Dadarshis, a Persian, my servant, the
satrap of Bactria, fought a battle with the Margiani
(Frada was the leader of the rising here) on the 23rd
day of the month of Atriyadiya. By the grace of
Auramazda my army defeated the hostile army very
severely. Dadarshis slew 4203 of them, and took 6562
prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Then the land was mine. Vahyazdata,
who called himself Bardiya, sent an army to Arachosia
against the Persian Vivana, my servant, the
satrap of Arachosia. 'Go up,' he said to them; 'defeat
Vivana and the army, which calls itself the army
of king Darius.' There is a fortress, Kapisakani by
name; there they fought the battle. By the grace
of Auramazda my army defeated the rebellious army
on the 13th of Anamaka. For a second time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
rebels marched against Vivana. In the district of
Gandutava (Ganduvada) on the 7th of the month
Viyakhna, my army defeated the rebellious army.
Then the general of Vahyazdata withdrew with his
faithful warriors to a fortress, Arsada by name, in
Arachosia. Vivana followed him with an army. Then
he seized him and slew him and the captains who
were with him. I sent out a part of the Persian
and Median army which was with me; I made
Artavardiya, a Persian, my servant, the general of it;
Artavardiya marched to Persia; the rest of the army
went with me to Media. When Artavardiya was in
Persia, there is a city Rakha (Racha); to this Vahyazdata
who called himself Bardiya marched to fight
against Artavardiya. Auramazda came to my aid;
on the 12th of Thuravahara my army defeated the
army of Vahyazdata very severely. Then Vahyazdata
went to Pisicauvada. From thence he marched against
Artavardiya and gave him battle. There is a mountain
Paraga (Parga) by name; there they fought
on the 6th day of Garmapada. By the grace of
Auramazda my army defeated that of Vahyazdata;
and they seized Vahyazdata and also his chief
adherents. Uvadaidaya is a city in Persia; there
I crucified Vahyazdata and the captains who were
with him."</p>

<p>The connection between these various battles is no
doubt as follows. When Babylon had fallen in the
autumn of the year 519 <small>B.C.</small> and the new Nebuchadnezzar
had been executed, Darius set out in the spring
of the year 518 <small>B.C.</small> Hydarnes maintained himself
against Phraortes on the western border of Media,
Dadarshis against the rebels in Armenia, and Hystaspes
in Parthia. The new pretender to the name of Smerdis
ruled in Persia, and his attempt to gain possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of the lands farther to the east and of Arachosia was
first checked by the defeat which he suffered from
the satrap of Arachosia in a battle fought in December
of the year 519 <small>B.C.</small> In all these directions, in
Armenia and Parthia, help was needed, and the decision
lay in Persia and Media. Darius did not
direct his march against Persia, but against Media.
There, as he acutely saw, lay the main strength of
the rebellion. His approach terrified the Susiani;
they slay their chief, their king Martiya, and submit.
Arrived at the border of Media and Persia, Darius
divides his army. To make use of the mutual
jealousy of the Persians and Medes, and to prevent
any contact of his Median troops with their rebellious
kinsmen, he sends the Persian Artavardiya with the
Median troops to Persia against Vahyazdata, and
with the Persians he marches against Phraortes to
Media. Hydarnes waited for him at Campada; the
first object was to unite the troops. The road from
Susiana to Ecbatana ran through the district of Cambadene.
When united with Hydarnes Darius overcomes
Phraortes in the month of Adukanis (perhaps
in June) of the year 518 at Kudurus, pursues him
to Ragha, and takes him prisoner. Before he executed
him in front of the citadel of Deioces, Phraortes, and
Cyaxares, he had cut off his nose, ears, and tongue,
and in this condition he had publicly exhibited him
in chains, in order to convince the Medes that they
had nothing to hope from the supposed scion of
Cyaxares. The rebellion of the Medes is at an end.
Darius can divide his forces. From Ragha he sends
aid to his father Hystaspes in Parthia, and with this
additional aid Hystaspes is able to defeat the rebellion
of the Parthians in Garmapada, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the summer
of 518 <small>B.C.</small> At the same time Dadarshis had received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the support in Armenia for which he was waiting,
under the protection of the fortress of Uhyama. The
Persian Vaumi&ccedil;a, who brought up the reinforcements
for Darius, defeats the Armenian rebels in Anamaka,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in December of the year 518 <small>B.C.</small>; a second victory
of Vaumi&ccedil;a, in Yiyar (May) of the following year
(517 <small>B.C.</small>), puts an end to the rebellion in Armenia.
A third army was sent by Darius after the fall of
Phraortes against the Sagartians; which overpowered
them and took their chief Chitratakhma prisoner.
Meanwhile Artavardiya, whom Darius had sent from
Susiana, when on his march against Phraortes, to
check the rebellion in the native land, had fought
with success against Vahyazdata. The latter had
weakened his forces by sending a detachment to
Arachosia. Vivana, the satrap of Arachosia, had repulsed
their attack in December 519 at Kapisakani,
and in March (Viyakhna) of the year 518 <small>B.C.</small> he had
entirely destroyed them. This failure in the east
was followed in the same spring by the attack of
Artavardiya from the west. First defeated in Thuravahara
(April) at Racha, Vahyazdata succumbed in
the summer (in Garmapada) at Mount Paraga, five
days after Hystaspes had again become master of the
Parthians in the north-east of Iran. The forces of the
satrap of Bactria, the second Dadarshis, had sufficed
to put an end to the rebellion of the Margians.</p>

<p>That which the deed of &Ccedil;ikathauvatis, the assassination
of Gaumata in the spring of the year 521 <small>B.C.</small>,
was intended to prevent, had nevertheless happened.
The whole kingdom was disorganised. In ceaseless
conflicts, which extended over four years, from the
autumn of 521 <small>B.C.</small> to the spring of 517 <small>B.C.</small>, Darius
had reconquered it, step by step. He had been compelled
to reduce by force of arms even the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
foundation of it, the native land of Persia, and to carry
on once more the conflict between Persia and Media.
It had been necessary to repeat the achievements of
Cyrus, if not to their full extent yet in part under far
more difficult conditions. The new king had passed
with success through the severest crisis, and had
reorganised the kingdom. This was the result of
his indomitable persistence before Babylon. By this
means he had retained the Medes and Persians of
his army in their fidelity, and by the final success had
filled them with self-confidence. The fear which afterwards
preceded his arms, certainly rendered more easy
the decisive victory of Kudurus and at Mount Paraga.</p>

<p>Darius had not yet reached the goal; the kingdom
was not entirely pacified. The reduction of Babylon
and the execution of Nebuchadnezzar III. had not
eradicated the strong impulse which the Babylonians
felt to regain their independence. They were once
more carried away by the charm which the name of
Nebuchadnezzar exercised upon them: "When I was
in Persia and Media," so Darius relates at the close of
the third column of the great inscription of Behistun,
"the Babylonians became rebellious for the second
time. A man of the name of Arakha, an Armenian,
rose up in the city of Dubana (Dubala, Dibleh?)
in Babylonia. 'I am Nebuchadnezzar, the son of
Nabonetus,' such was his falsehood: he made himself
master of the city of Babylon and was king. I sent
Intaphernes, my servant, a Mede, with an army
against Babylon. Intaphernes took Babylon, and
slew much people. On the 22nd of the month
Markazana, Arakha with his chief adherents was
captured;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> then I ordered them to be crucified in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Babylon." No doubt Darius had left sufficient garrisons
in the two royal citadels of the city which he
had conquered with so much trouble, and, therefore,
it is the more remarkable that Arakha, who did not
rebel in Babylon itself, was able to make himself
master of the city. We may assume that Darius did
not give the Babylonians time to fill up the breaches
which he had made in the walls of Babylon; this
time the Median Intaphernes must have found the
task lighter. The second rising of the Babylonians
seems to have seduced the Susiani, and to have
caused a third rebellion of this land. In a fifth
column, subsequently added to the inscription of
Behistun, we have information about this rebellion of
the Susiani and the reduction of the Sac&aelig;. But this
part of the inscription is so greatly injured that only
a few words can be read with certainty. All that is
clear is that Gaubaruva (Gobryas), the father-in-law
of Darius and one of the Seven, was sent against the
Susiani and conquered them, that Darius himself
marched against the Sac&aelig;, that he fought against the
<i>&Ccedil;aka tigrakhauda</i>, i.&nbsp;e. against the Sac&aelig; with pointed
caps, and conquered them on the sea (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> on the
Caspian), that he captured and slew their chief
&Ccedil;akunka. Polyaenus has preserved a few details
of the war against the Sac&aelig;, though they rest on
little authority; they prove that it was carried on in
the neighbourhood of Bactria, and was a serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
struggle.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Darius recapitulates the narrative of the
achievements of the first years of his reign thus:
"This is what I accomplished, what I accomplished
always with the grace of Auramazda; I have fought
nineteen battles, and taken captive nine kings."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>In remembrance of these deeds and achievements,
Darius erected a magnificent memorial in that flourishing
district of Media which the Medes called
Bagistana, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> land of the gods. The Choaspes
(Kerkha) rises on the southern slope of the Elvend,
on the northern slope of which lay Ecbatana.
Breaking through the mountain rim of Iran, it flows
down a long and narrow valley towards the south
into the Lower Tigris. In its upper course the
Choaspes traverses an elevated depression, which is
now thickly strewn with villages, the chosen summer
abode of the shepherd tribes. To the north this
depression is bounded by a steep mountain-chain,
twenty miles in length, which ends towards the east
in a precipitous wall of rock more than 1500 feet
high. On this wall, which looks towards the rising
sun, over a clear fountain which springs at the foot of
the rock, Darius caused a part of the stone 300 feet
above the plain to be made smooth with the chisel,
polished and cut in relief; the relief is explained by
two inscriptions, a shorter one above and a longer one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
below, in cuneiform letters. At the foot of the rock
there was a park (paradisus) twelve stades in the
circuit.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Being placed in Media, this monument was
no doubt intended to remind the Medes that any
rebellion against the power of the Persians even under
the most favourable circumstances would fail. The
rock-picture represents Darius, who in size towers over
the other figures. He wears a robe which in front
falls down over the knee, and behind to the middle of
the calf, a crown, a simple fillet with spikes on his
head; rings are on his arms, the hair is long, the
beard curled. Behind him stand a bow-bearer and a
lance-bearer, both with long robes and beards. The
king places his right foot on a man lying on the
ground. Below this we can read: "This Gaumata, the
Magian, lied: he said, 'I am Bardiya, the son of
Kurus; I am king.'" Opposite to Darius, bound to
each other by a rope round their necks, and their
hands tied behind them, stand nine kings with their
heads uncovered (the last only has a very tall pointed
cap, which marks him as the king of the <i>&Ccedil;aka
tigrakhauda</i>), clothed in various garments. Over the
first form, which is clad in a long beautiful robe reaching
to the ancles, we read: "This Atrina lied; he said:
'I am king in Susiana'"; and over the second, in a
short robe: "This Naditabira lied; he said thus: 'I
am Nabukadrachara, the son of Nabunita, I am king of
Babylon.'" Near the third figure, also in a short garment,
is written: "This Fravartis lied; he said: 'I am
Khsathrita, of the race of Uvakhshathra, I am king in
Media.'" The fourth wears Persian clothing: "This
Martiya lied; he said; 'I am Ymani, king in Susiana.'"
Over the fifth form we find: "This Chitratakhma lied;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
he said: 'I am king in Sagartia, of the race of
Uvakshathra.'" Over the sixth, who is clothed as
a Persian: "This Vahyazdata lied; he said: 'I am
Bardiya, the son of Kurus; I am king.'" Over
the seventh prisoner, who is clothed like the second,
we read: "This Arakha lied; he said thus: 'I am
Nabukadrachara, the son of Nabunita; I am king
in Babylon.'" Over the eighth, who wears Persian
garments: "This Frada lied; he said thus: 'I am
king in Margiana.'" The ninth stands a little further
back; the inscription tells us: "This is &Ccedil;akunka, the
Sacian." The picture does not mention the conquest
of the Parthians, Hyrcanians, Assyrians, Armenians,
and Sattagydae. In the midst, above the whole
description, hovers Auramazda, a solemn, aged countenance,
with long hair and beard, visible only to the
knees, in a winged circle.</p>

<p>Under this picture, at the close of the fourth column,
before the account of the new rebellion of the Susiani
and the subjugation of the Sac&aelig;, the inscription tells
us: "What I have done, I have done by the grace of
Auramazda. Auramazda came to my aid, and the
other gods, who did so because I was not hostile;
because I was not a liar or violent. Thou, who
readest these inscriptions, may they tell thee what I
have done. Regard them not as lies. These lands
which became rebellious to me, the lie made them
rebellious. Thou who wilt be king hereafter, guard
against the lie. Punish severely the man who is a
liar; if thou keepest this mind, my land will be
powerful. Thou who seest this tablet hereafter, destroy
it not. If thou preservest it as long as thou canst,
Auramazda will be favourable to thee; thou wilt
have descendants, and live long, and may Auramazda
cause that to succeed which thou dost undertake. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
thou destroyest this tablet, may Auramazda smite
thee, may he give thee no posterity, and what thou
doest may he render vain.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>"</p>

incorrectly regards Zopyrus as one of the seven. Diodorus attempts
to unite the statements of Herodotus and Ctesias, by maintaining that
Zopyrus was also called Megabyzus; the "twenty Babylons" are
reduced to ten. (Exc. Vat. p. 34, 35 = 10, 19.) In Herod. (4, 143) Darius
wishes when he opens the finest pomegranate that he had as many
Megabyzuses (the father of Zopyrus is meant) as the fruit had seeds.
Plutarch transfers this to Zopyrus, and represents Darius as saying
that he would rather have Zopyrus uninjured than 100 Babylons;
"Reg. Apophthegm." 3. In Polyaenus (7, 12), Zopyrus imitates the
device which Sirakes, a Sacian, had previously employed against
Darius, and opens the gates of Babylon to the Persians by night.</p></div>

which the golden image of Belus was taken away from the lower

of the destruction of Belus by Xerxes, p. 738. If Darius, as Herodotus
tells us, 3, 159, "destroyed the gates of Babylon," it does not follow
that he opened the supposed tomb of Nitocris over the main gateway,
because it made it impassable, as Herodotus thinks (1, 187).</p></div>

510. But chronological dates are not to be obtained by merely emending
the text. According to the context and the first line of Col. v. Darius
said in reference to the four preceding columns: "This I have done up
to this or that year." Then follows the narrative of the new rebellion

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF DARIUS ON THE INDUS
AND THE DANUBE.</h3>


<p>Aeschylus represents the Persians as saying, "A
great, prosperous, victorious life was granted to us by
destiny, when King Darius, the lord of the bow,
Susa's beloved captain, governed the land, without
fault or failure, like a god. The Persians called him
their divine counsellor: he was filled with a godlike
wisdom, and wisely did he, the Susa-born god of
Persia, lead our army. We were seen in splendid
array; there was ready for him the unwearying might
of armed men, and troops mingled from all nations,
and the return from the wars was glorious. According
to his will, he ruled the wealthy populous cities of the
Greeks in the land of Ionia, and the wave-beaten
islands of the seas, adjacent to that land, Chios,
Lesbos and Samos rich in olives, and Lemnos between
both shores, and the cities of Cyprus, Paphos, Soli,
and Salamis. Many cities he took adjacent to the
Thracian borders on the Strymonian Sea: even the
walled cities, far from the shore, obeyed him, and the
famous cities on the strait of Helle, on the bay of the
Propontis, and the mouth of the Pontus. Beloved
hero, thy like lies not in the land of Persia."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>The rebellions were crushed, the kingdom of Cyrus
was once more established. Darius took precautions
to prevent the recurrence of such serious dangers, and
to bring the nations into a lasting state of dependence.
He created fixed districts for government, strengthened
the action of the central power, secured the necessary
means for this, and sought to arrange the taxes and
tributes of the provinces and settle them at fixed
contributions. Along with this improvement in the
organization of the kingdom he kept in sight the
extension of it; he did not wish to be left behind
Cyrus and Cambyses in this respect. We cannot
decide whether the northern boundary of the kingdom
reached the Caucasus in the time of Cyrus; it is
certain that under Darius the nations between the
Black and the Caspian Sea, the Colchians, the
Tibarenes, Chalybes, Moschians, and Saspeires, were
subject to the Persians. Herodotus observes that the
Colchians and their neighbours paid the tribute
which they had imposed upon themselves&mdash;which
implies that these nations submitted voluntarily.
"The empire of the Persians," Herodotus tells us,
"extends to the Caucasus; the territory to the north
pays no heed to them."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> It was a considerable gain
when the kingdom extended as far as the Caucasus,
or included the whole range; for by this means it
acquired a strong natural border, and at the same
time controlled the trading road which ran from the
east and the Caspian Sea through the valleys of the
Cyrus (Kur) and the Phasis to the Black Sea.</p>

<p>In the East Cyrus, as we saw, had already advanced
as far as the Indus; he had conquered the A&ccedil;vakas on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the north of the Cabul, and the Gandaras to the south
of that river. Of their neighbours, Bactria and
Arachosia had remained true during the great rebellion,
though the Sattagyd&aelig; (the Gedrosians) had
revolted. Darius had himself marched against the
Sac&aelig;, and reduced them again to subjection. Herodotus
tells us, that he sent out a party to explore the
Indus; in which was Scylax, an inhabitant of
Caryanda in Caria. They set out from the land of the
Pactyes (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from Arachosia), and from the city of
Caspatyrus (Cabul) they followed the course of the
Indus to the sea. Then they sailed to the west, and
in the thirtieth month they arrived at the point from
which the Phenicians started, who sailed round Africa
at the command of Necho (III. 313), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> they did not
return to the Persian Gulf but sailed round Arabia,
and landed in the north-west corner of the Arabian
Gulf at Heroonpolis. After their return Darius made
use of this sea, and subjugated the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The
extension of the Persian kingdom in the land of the
Indus, by Darius, is beyond a doubt. In the inscription
which he caused to be engraved on Mount
Behistun after the suppression of the rebellions, he
enumerates the nations which obey him. We can
find but one name of an Indian nation to the right of
the Indus&mdash;the Gandaras. The inscription of the
palace of Persepolis, which Darius built a few years
later, mentions the Idhus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Indians, besides
the Gandarians. Herodotus further informs us that
it was the Northern Indians whom Darius had subjugated.
They formed the twentieth satrapy of his
kingdom, while the Gandarians were united with the
Arachoti in the seventh satrapy. The twentieth
satrapy of Northern Indians comprised the lands to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the north of Cabul, on the right bank of the stream,
from the land of the A&ccedil;vakas as far as the summits of
the Himalayas. It paid 360 talents of gold, the
highest tax among all the satrapies of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>In the west Darius pursued even more extensive
plans. If Cambyses had trodden the soil of Africa,
his armies were to cross the western sea, and carry
the empire of Persia into Europe&mdash;a point which none
of the great warrior princes of the east had as yet
reached. Diodorus tells us, that Darius, filled with
eager desire to extend his dominion, master of almost
all Asia, and trusting to the magnitude of the Persian
power, desired to conquer Europe as his ancestors had
defeated the mightiest nations with less forces.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The
first achievement of Darius in this direction was the
conquest of Samos, the most powerful and prosperous
of the islands on the coast of Asia Minor. Oroetes
had already prepared the way for this by inviting
Polycrates to Magnesia and there putting him to
an ignominious death, for when Polycrates was master
of Samos and at the head of the splendid naval power
which he had created he could contest with Persia the
possession of the &AElig;gean (p. 143, 231). Polycrates had
left the most trusted of his dependents, Maeandrius,
as regent during his absence. On the news of the
death of Polycrates, he declared his willingness to
lay down his power. But when the nobles of Samos
demanded an account of the treasures of Polycrates
which were in the hands of Maeandrius, he treacherously
seized those who made the demand, threw
them into prison, and maintained himself as tyrant.
At an earlier time, Polycrates, in close union with his
two brothers, Pantagnotus and Syloson, had made
himself master of Samos: he then removed the former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
out of his path, and sent the second into banishment.
Syloson went to Egypt to amuse himself with the
sights of the country. There, according to Herodotus,
he was one day seen by Darius, who was then in Egypt
with Cambyses, in the market-place of Memphis, clad
in a red cloak. The cloak pleased Darius and he
wished to purchase it, but Syloson hastened to offer
it as a present to the Persian prince. When Darius
became king, Syloson went to Susa, as Herodotus relates,
placed himself at the gate of the palace, and
told the door-keeper that he had done a service to the
king. Darius in astonishment at such an assertion from
a Greek, caused Syloson to be brought, remembered
the cloak, and was prepared to reward the gift by a
liberal present of gold and silver. But Syloson urged
the king to restore him to the throne of Polycrates,
which was now in the hands of a man who had been a
slave in his family; the island was to be spared.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Whether this narrative has any real foundation or
not (in any case Susa must be struck out) Darius
found it advantageous to get Samos into his power;
and, as we have seen, it was a maxim from the time of
Cyrus to set up princes in the maritime cities and
the islands, who owed their power to the Persians,
and who could only maintain it with their help. He
commanded Otanes, whose service in the assassination
of the Magi we know, to cross over into Samos. The
Samians had no inclination to fight in the cause of
Maeandrius, nor did they venture to resist the Persians.
When Otanes landed with the Persian troops,
Maeandrius with his dependants retired into the citadel,
and sent a message to Otanes that he was prepared to
quit the island. When this had been agreed upon,
the captains of the Persians waited without suspicion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
before the citadel for the departure of Maeandrius
and his associates, and for the opening of the gates.
Then the half-witted brother of Maeandrius, Charilaus,
who had been confined in prison in the citadel, burst
forth from the open gates with the old mercenaries of
Polycrates and fell upon the nearest Persians, who in
reliance on the treaty were unprepared for an enemy,
and cut the captains down, while Maeandrius passed
by a subterranean passage to the sea, and embarked
on board ship. The mass of the Persians hastened
to the rescue; the mercenaries were driven back into
the citadel. Enraged at the treachery, Otanes gave
the command to cut down all the Samians who fell
into the hands of the Persians both within and
without the walls. The city was set on fire, and the
flames injured the temple of Hera, which was the
largest building in Greece after the temple of Artemis
at Ephesus. When the citadel had fallen, Syloson
received from the Persians (516 <small>B.C.</small>) the ruined city
and the desolate island. He enjoyed the throne but a
short time, which he had purchased by the ruin of the
flourishing country, and vassalage to the great king.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
The island recovered from the blow which it received
from the Persians. Twenty years after the subjugation
it could once more equip and man 60 triremes.</p>

<p>The possession of Samos completed the dominion of
Darius over the coasts of Anatolia. It was of greater
importance to get into his power the two straits
which separate Europe from Asia&mdash;the Hellespont
and the Bosphorus. If the Greek cities on the Asiatic
side were subject, the cities and lands beyond were still
to be conquered, and with the conquest of these the
Persian empire would set foot in Europe. Perinthus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
a colony of the recently-conquered Samos, Selymbria
on the northern shore of the Propontis, and Byzantium
on the Bosphorus, both colonies of Megara, recognised
the dominion of Darius; in Byzantium, the most
important of these cities, a tyrant, Ariston by name,
soon took the lead.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The European shore of the Hellespont,
the Thracian Chersonesus, had been for more
than forty years under the rule of a princely family,
which sprang from Attica. One of the oldest noble
families in Attica, which had retired from the country
before the usurpation of Pisistratus in 560 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;the
Philaidae, had established a principality there, by
protecting and securing the Doloncian Thracians in
the peninsula against their fellow-countrymen the
Apsinthians, who dwelt at the mouth of the Hebrus.
The position which the first of these princes, Miltiades
II., thus obtained in the Hellespont, filled the city of
Lampsacus, which lay opposite, on the Asiatic shore,
with jealousy and anxiety for her trade; the question
in dispute was the control of the busy strait.
Lampsacus waged long and vigorous war against
Miltiades and his nephew and successor Stesagoras.
The latter was followed by his younger brother,
Miltiades III. (about 518 <small>B.C.</small>), who had taken the
reins of government tightly in hand. The forces of
the little principality did not suffice to offer resistance
to the Persians; and the walls of Sestos and Cardia
were insufficient. We hear of no resistance, and
Miltiades passed into the series of Persian vassal
princes. In this way he was secured against Lampsacus
and Sigeum also, where Pisistratus, in league
with Polycrates of Samos, had placed his younger son
Hegesistratus as prince about the year 533 <small>B.C.</small>, who
became a vassal of Persia when Cambyses demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
ships from the Greek cities, or after the fall of
Polycrates, or certainly when Darius extended his
sovereignty over Samos.</p>

<p>By the subjugation of Byzantium and the Thracian
Chersonesus, Darius was not merely master of the
whole of the important trade of the Greek cities of
Asia Minor, and the cantons of Hellas, with the
north shore of the Black Sea, but the path into
Europe was in his hand. According to Ctesias, he
bade Ariamnes, his satrap in Cappadocia, sail to
Scythia and there make prisoners. Ariamnes carried
out the command with thirty penteconters, and brought
back captives.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> If the statement is correct, it must
refer to an investigation of the north coast of the
Black Sea, similar to that made by Darius of the east
on the Indus (p. 260), and at a later time of the
coasts of Hellas and Magna Graecia.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Darius contemplated
a great expedition; he wished to cross
the straits with a large force, but not to pass to
the west against Macedonia and the cantons of the
Greeks, but to the north beyond the Danube. It
must have seemed more important to him to secure
himself in the north first; the conquest of the west
he regarded as less urgent, and also as a less important
undertaking. Herodotus tells us that Darius' object
was to avenge the incursion which the Scythians
made, at the time of Cyaxares, into Media.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> It is his
manner to connect events by a nexus of guilt and
punishment; Darius cared very little for the disaster
which had fallen on Media. We shall be more
correct in ascribing to him the intention of getting the
whole shore of the Black Sea into his power, in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
that he might reduce the western and northern
coasts, when, the south-west, as far as the Caucasus,
being already subjugated, the whole sea would be a
Persian lake. On the northern edge lay a district
fertile in corn, and flourishing colonies of the Greeks.
With this territory and these cities the Persian
kingdom would have gained the mouth of the rivers
of the north, and the outlet of the trading roads to
the nations of the north, as it had already got command
of the trading roads which met from the east
and west in Colchis. But what really happened to
the north of the Danube, so far as we can fix the
incidents, does not agree with this plan. The object
of the enterprise, unless we assume that Darius only
wished to carry his arms to the most remote
nations, cannot be made clear, nor can we follow with
certainty all the phases in it.</p>

<p>If Cambyses had supported his expedition against
Egypt by the navy of the Phenician cities and the
Greek cities of Anatolia, Darius had still more urgent
need of their sailors to convey him to Europe, across
the Danube. To the mariners of the Anatolian coasts
and the islands lying off them, the waters of the Black
Sea and the mouths of the Danube and Borysthenes
were hardly less familiar than the shores of the
&AElig;gean. This co-operation was therefore the most
essential. Darius called out the navy of the Greek
cities of his kingdom, and that navy only; employment
was found for the Phenician fleet was another direction.
The Greeks had to furnish no less than 600 triremes,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a fleet of which the crews reached the total of
120,000 men. That fleet was intended to convey the
land army, the levy of the entire kingdom, across the
straits, and it must assemble before the army arrived.
The task before it was the transport of 700,000 men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
for that, according to Herodotus, was the strength
of the army of Darius, with numerous horses, and the
enormous train of servants, porters, and beasts of
burden to Europe. This involved the embarkation
and debarkation of the animals,&mdash;a long and difficult
operation; it was desirable to lose as little time as
possible, and more desirable still to keep and maintain
a safe connection with Asia in the rear of the army.
Hence Darius considered whether it were possible to
bridge over one of the straits. He found a Greek
who undertook to carry out this idea, and had no
scruples in building a bridge to connect the mighty
Persian empire with Europe, and facilitate the subjugation
of his own countrymen in their native land.
In the island of Samos, so recently conquered by
Darius, were the best engineers in Greece. After the
construction of the great temple of Hera had been
begun, the Samians had found various opportunities of
exercising their skill. A long and difficult acqueduct,
and breakwaters for the protection of the harbour,
had been partly begun and partly carried out before
the reign of Polycrates; the building of the palace,
the strong fortifications, and, above all, the great docks
and harbour-works, which Polycrates set on foot,
had given yet further practice to the Samians. From
this school came Mandrocles, who undertook the
construction of the bridge.</p>

<p>Darius commanded Mandrocles to build a bridge
over the Bosphorus, which lay in the direction of his
march. This strait was narrower than the Hellespont,
but the current which sets through it from north to
south was much stronger. Mandrocles began the
structure with the crews and materials of the fleet
which had been ordered to assemble.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Several hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>dreds
of ships, fastened together, were placed in the
strait,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and carefully anchored against the north wind
and the current. On the coast of Asia, the bridge
lay to the north of the city of Chalcedon and in its
territory; Herodotus supposes that the European end
touched the shore between Byzantium and the temple,
which, situated to the north of Byzantium at the
mouth of the Pontus, served as a signal to the
ships entering the Bosphorus.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Polybius remarks
that the bridge "was said" to end at the Hermaeum,
which lay on the promontory of the European shore.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Strabo places this temple ten stadia to the south
of the northern entrance of the Bosphorus.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Hence
we may assume that Mandrocles constructed his
bridge across the narrowest part of the strait, about
1000 paces in breadth,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and that it lay at the place
where the castles of Anadoli Hissari and Rumili
Hissari now stand opposite each other.</p>

<p>The army was collected, the bridge was ready, when
Darius came to Chalcedon. He inspected the bridge,
and was greatly pleased with the construction; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
embarked on board ship and proceeded for some
distance into the Pontus, then he returned to the
temple of Zeus Urius on the shore of Asia, at the
mouth of the Bosphorus, and looked out into the sea.
Before his wishes and his power, and the skill of his
Greek engineer, the impossible had become possible;
the Bosphorus was compelled to submit to a bridge.
Mandrocles received the most valuable presents. The
fleet of the Ionians lay on the Black Sea, when the
army, which was the greatest that a Persian sovereign
had ever brought together, commenced the passage.
The train was interminable which filed before the
king over the sea; the rock on which Darius sat was
pointed out for a long time afterwards. Even "shepherd
Sac&aelig;, of the race of the Scythians, the children
of a nomad race," passed over the bridge;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> the
nomads of the steppes of the Oxus were led by Darius
against the nomads of the steppes to the north of the
Pontus. In remembrance of this passage Darius
caused two columns of white stone to be erected on
the European shore, which recorded the names of all
the nations included in the army; the inscription on
one side was in the Persian cuneiform (in Assyrian
letters, as Herodotus says), and on the other in the
Hellenic language and letters. Mandrocles also was
proud of his work, and dedicated a picture which
represented the bridge, the army crossing it, and
Darius sitting on his throne, in the great sanctuary of
his city, the temple of Hera at Samos, with the
following inscription: "When Mandrocles bridged
the fish-teeming Bosphorus, he dedicated this picture
to Hera in remembrance of the floating bridge. He
obtained the crown, the glory of the Samians, in that he
completed the work to the satisfaction of King Darius."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the year 513 <small>B.C.</small> that the armies of Asia
trod the soil of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The fleet was ordered to
sail along the Thracian coast in the Pontus, then to
enter the mouth of the Danube, and there prepare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
means for the army to cross the river, by procuring
supplies, and constructing a bridge, no easy task considering
the breadth and rapidity of the stream. The
sovereigns of the Greek cities, who owed their elevation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
to the Persian king, commanded their ships in person,
as Darius had taken the field in person, or entrusted
them to their sons. Thus Histiaeus the son of Lysagoras,
the sovereign of Miletus, which was the most powerful
of the Greek cities of the coast, commanded his own
ships, Laodamas the ships of Phocaea, Aeaces the son
of Syloson the ships of Samos, Strattis the ships of
Chios, Aristagoras the ships of Cyzicus, Metrodorus
those of Proconnesus in the Propontis, Daphnis the
ships of Abydus. The ships of Lampsacus were in the
charge of Hippoclus, those of Parium in the charge
of Herophantus; and lastly, the sovereigns of the
recently-conquered districts, Ariston and Miltiades,
commanded the ships of Byzantium, of Sestos, and
Cardia. While the fleet sailed to the Danube, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
land army marched for two days from the coast, to
the north, in the direction of the Balkan. At the
sources of the Tearus, which no doubt are those of
the Simir dere, which near Bunar Hissar send up warm
and cold springs&mdash;thirty-eight in number according
to Herodotus&mdash;the army rested three days; Darius
caused a monument to be erected with an inscription,
which Herodotus gives thus: "The springs of the
Tearus supply the best and purest water of all rivers,
and to these on his march against the Scyths came
the bravest and most handsome of men, Darius the
son of Hystaspes, the king of the Persians and of all
the mainland."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>The tribes of the Thracians, through whose districts
the expedition marched, submitted without opposition.
These were the inhabitants of the region of Salmydessus;
the Odrysae in the valley of the Artiscus
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Teke deresi or Nessowa), the Skyrmiads and
Nipsaeans, who dwelt near Apollonia, the Greek city
on this coast (a colony of Miletus, now Sizepoli),
and Mesembria, now Misivri (a colony of the Greeks,
planted soon after the other).<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> It was not till the
Persians had passed the heights of the Balkan that
they found resistance. Between this range and the
Danube were the Getae, called by Herodotus the most
brave and just of all the Thracians. They offered an
obstinate resistance, but were nevertheless at once
crushed by overpowering numbers.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Meanwhile the
fleet had advanced two days' voyage up the river from
the mouth, and placed the bridge there, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
place where the river becomes one stream. By this
bridge the Greek army, to use the expression of Herodotus,
passed "over the greatest river which we know."
Strabo says that the bridge was placed over the lower
part of the southern, and largest, of the mouths of the
Danube; which was called the sacred mouth. On the
further shore began the land of the Scoloti. When the
army had crossed the Danube, Darius, as Herodotus
relates, wished to destroy the bridge and employ the
crews in his army. But on the advice of Coes of
Lesbos, who pointed out that he must leave the way
open for his return, Darius abandoned his purpose; he
then summoned the princes of Ionia, and gave them
a thong with 60 knots, bidding them untie a knot each
day. If the army did not return to the bridge in
these 60 days they were to go home.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The three kings of the Scoloti (III. 236) Idanthyrsus,
who inherited the largest dominion, Scopasis
and Taxakis&mdash;so Herodotus relates&mdash;as soon as they
received news of the approach of Darius, sent messengers
to their neighbours to ask for assistance. The
kings of the Agathyrsi (the western neighbours of
the Scoloti), the Neuri, the Cannibals and Melanchl&aelig;ni
(who lay to the north), and the kings of the
Sarmatians, Geloni, and Budini, who dwelt in the
east beyond the Don, assembled for consultation.
The kings of the Sarmatians, Geloni, and Budini
agreed to send help to the Scoloti, but the rest
refused. As the Agathyrsi, Neuri, Cannibals, and
Melanchl&aelig;ni would not help them in the contest, the
Scoloti determined to decline battle with the Persians
and retire. Their wives and children they placed on
chariots together with the rest of their goods, took
their slaves and herds and marched to a secure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
position in the north; only so much cattle was left
with the army as was necessary for its support.
Then the army was divided into two parts. One
under the command of Scopasis was to unite with the
Sarmatians and retire straight towards the Don, if
the Persians took that direction; it was to keep one
or two marches ahead of the Persians, to stop up the
springs and fountains, and destroy the pastures; but
if Darius turned, it was at once to pursue the Persians.
The other part of the army, under Idanthyrsus and
Taxakis, was to unite with the Budini and Geloni,
and to march in a similar manner to the north as
far as the land of the Neuri, the Cannibals, and
Melanchl&aelig;ni, in order to involve them in the war.
The army of Scopasis found the Persians already
three days' march on their side of the Danube. It
retired, and the Persians pursued as far as the Don.
When the Scoloti and Sarmatians crossed the river, the
Persians crossed it also; in pursuit of the Scythians
they marched through the land of the Sarmatians,
reached that of the Budini, where they burned the
great wooden city of the Geloni, which they found
entirely deserted, and at length came to the desert which
extended for seven days' journey to the north of the
land of the Budini. When Darius reached the desert
he abandoned the further pursuit, and encamped his
army on the bank of the Oarus (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Volga). At
the same time he built eight great fortresses, at equal
distances, each about sixty stades from the other, the
remains of which, Herodotus remarks, existed in his
day. While Darius was thus occupied, the army of
Scopasis in the north marched back into their own
land and united with the army of Idanthyrsus.
When the Scythians were no more to be seen, Darius
left the fortresses unfinished, turned to the west,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
under the impression that the Scythians would retire
in that direction, hastened in rapid marches to the
land of the Scoloti, and there found the united army
of the Scythians. Again the Scoloti retired, and as
Darius did not cease to press them, they passed, as
they had resolved, over the northern boundary of their
land, into the land of the Melanchl&aelig;ni, who dwelt
beyond the Scoloti, between the Don and the Gerrhus,
a tributary of the Dnieper. From the land of the
Melanchl&aelig;ni they proceeded yet further to the west,
through the land of the Cannibals into that of the
Neuri, who lay above the lake out of which the
Dniester flows (III. 231). All these tribes fled before
the approach of the Scoloti and the Persians to the
north; but when the Scoloti wished to cross the
borders of the Agathyrsi, they prepared to defend
them, and compelled the Scoloti to return from the
land of the Neuri to the south into their own land.</p>

<p>When this went on, and there was no end, Darius
sent a horseman to Idanthyrsus with the request that
he would either stand and fight, if he had the forces
to do so, or send earth and water to him as his
master. Idanthyrsus answered that the Scoloti had
neither cities nor lands which made it necessary to
fight with the Persians in order to defend them; but
if Darius was eager for a battle, there were the tombs
of their fathers; let him discover these and attack
them, he would then see whether the Scoloti dare
fight or not. On this the Scoloti sent the part of
the army which Scopasis commanded, with the Sarmatians,
to the Danube, in order to negotiate with
the Ionians at the bridge, but the army of Idanthyrsus
was not to retire any longer, but to attack the Persians
as soon as they began to prepare the meal
after the day's march. This was done, and each time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the Persian cavalry were put to flight by the Scoloti;
but as soon as the foot soldiers came to the rescue
of the cavalry, the Scoloti retired. In this way the
Scoloti attacked the Persians by night also. And
their kings (Idanthyrsus and Taxakis) sent to Darius
a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows. Gobryas, the
father-in-law of Darius, interpreted these gifts to
mean, that the Scythian message was: Unless you
become birds and fly into heaven, or mice and creep
into the earth, or frogs and leap into the marshes,
you will succumb to our arrows. The Scoloti also,
who were now armed for battle, drew out with horse
and foot; and when they were in line, a hare ran
past and the Scoloti chased it, one after the other, as
they happened to catch sight of it. Then Darius said,
These men hold us in great contempt; Gobryas has
correctly interpreted the meaning of the gifts; we
must carefully consider how we are to secure our
return. Gobryas advised that they should light the
camp fires as usual when night came on; that they
should leave behind the sick and weak, who could
not bear burdens, in the camp, and with the rest set
out at once for the Danube before the Scythians
reached the river and broke down the bridge, or the
Ionians came to some resolution ruinous to the Persians.
This advice Darius followed. The sick and
exhausted, and all whose loss would be of little importance,
were commanded to defend the camp, as
the king with the rest of the army wished to make
an attack on the Scythians, and as soon as the fires
had been lighted Darius began his march to the
Danube. On the following morning those who had
been left behind perceived that they had been betrayed
by Darius, and prayed for quarter to the
Scythians. The whole army of the Scythians with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the Budini, the Geloni, and Sarmatians, went straight
to the Danube, for Scopasis with his division had
already retired from the river, after telling the Ionians
that they must not allow the bridge to stand after
the sixtieth day, and the Ionians had given a promise
to that effect. As all the Scythians were mounted
they marched far more rapidly than the Persians and
could soon have caught up Darius, had not the Persians
in ignorance taken a longer route, so that Idanthyrsus
with the whole army of the Scythians reached
the Danube before Darius arrived. The Scythians
now called upon the leaders of the Greeks to break
down the bridge, for the appointed time had passed;
by that means they would get rid of their master, and
might thank the gods and the Scythians for their
liberation. As the sixty days during which the fleet
was to remain in the Danube, by the command of
Darius, were really past, Miltiades of the Chersonnesus
urged the captains of the Greek ships to listen to
the request of the Scythians, and set the Ionians at
liberty. But Histiaeus, the tyrant of Miletus, said
that each of them held his power in his city by
Darius only; if the king's power were overthrown, he
would not be a tyrant in Miletus, nor would any
other tyrant keep his throne; every city would prefer
democracy to tyranny. When all, with the exception
of Miltiades, had agreed to this resolution, they determined
to remain, but to prevent the bridge from
being used by the Scythians they destroyed it for
the length of a bowshot from the northern bank.
Thinking that the Greeks were removing the whole
bridge, the Scythians returned, to seek out Darius
and destroy him. But they missed the Persians yet
a second time. They thought that the Persians
would seek out the places where the wells had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
been stopped up, and the pastures had not been
destroyed; but they returned by the way that they
came, and their enemies with great difficulty reached
the crossing of the Danube. It was night, the bridge
could not be found, and the Persians were in great
alarm that the Ionians had abandoned them. Then
Darius commanded an Egyptian, who had a very loud
voice, to come forward to the bank and call for
Histiaeus of Miletus. The cry was heard; Histiaeus
at once sent all the ships to transfer the troops, and
restored the bridge.</p>

<p>Clear and definite as the incidents are which lead
Darius to the Danube, the river is no sooner crossed
than everything passes into northern mists, into the
marvellous and the incredible. Let us first consider
the conduct of the Scoloti. The kings of the barbarous
north, though far distant from each other&mdash;Herodotus
gives the land of the Scoloti a length and
breath of 500 miles&mdash;meet in a great congress. Where
the congress was held we are not told. The kings of
the Agathyrsi, Neuri, Melanchl&aelig;ni, and Cannibals find
that the matter does not concern them, for they had
not invaded Media. But the distant tribes to the
east beyond the Don, the Sarmatians, Budini, and
Geloni, come a distance of hundreds of miles to assist
their neighbours; they carry their public spirit so far
as to sacrifice their own lands, regardless of which
the Budini and Geloni march with Idanthyrsus first
to the north and then to the west; the Sarmatians
follow Scopasis far to the north-east. Why the
Scythians divided their army in the first instance,
why they did not unite to meet Darius, we cannot
ascertain. We are not told what Idanthyrsus is doing
while Scopasis retires to the Volga; we only know
that the two armies again unite, while Darius is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
building the castles on the Volga. When united the
Scythians retire to the west as far as the borders of
the Agathyrsi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to Transylvania, the most foolish
thing for their own interests which they could have
done, for by this means they brought Darius back
into the neighbourhood of the Danube. On the
borders of the Agathyrsi Darius summons them to
battle. The princes answer that they will fight if he
attacks the tombs of their fathers. These tombs we
have found in the neighbourhood of the Gerrhus; they
are the numerous Kurgans below the rapids of the
Dnieper,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> a region which Darius must have traversed
on his way north-eastwards to the Volga. Darius does
not accede to the request of the Scythians. Nevertheless
they determined to attack the Persians, and
yet contradict the object of this attack by sending
Scopasis with his army and the Sarmatians to the
Danube, thus weakening the army. When Scopasis
and the Sarmatians are gone, Idanthyrsus offers the
battle hitherto so carefully avoided, with cavalry and
infantry, though Herodotus remarks that the Scythians
have no infantry. Meanwhile Scopasis comes with his
army to the Danube, not to fight with the Greeks but
to treat with them. What reasons had the Scythians
not to treat the Greeks as enemies? If they wished
to cut off the return of Darius, they must attack the
bridge and destroy it. If they thought that they
could not do this, or did not wish to do it, but to
treat, they need not have sent half the army with the
Sarmatians, but only a few horsemen. The Greeks
were able to protect the bridge with a fort, upon
which the Scythian cavalry could hardly have made
any effectual impression, or if they neglected to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
do that, they could at any moment, if watchful,
bring the bridge to their own side of the river,
and then secure it with all their ships till Darius
should appear on the farther shore. But the Scythians
send Scopasis with his army. He tells the Ionians
that he knew that Darius had ordered them to
wait sixty days; they were to wait till the time
had passed and then sail away. When the Greeks
had undertaken to do this Scopasis marches with his
army to the north. He joins Idanthyrsus again
when Darius has begun his retreat. The united army
reaches the bridge long before Darius. A second
time we have negotiations with the Ionians. The
sixty days are past, and the Scythians entreat the
Ionians to sail away now, at any rate. They are
satisfied when the Greeks remove a part of the
bridge, saying that they have begun to break it up
and will now sail home. They do not wait till
they see all the ships sailing down the stream. They
have cut off Darius; he cannot escape them and reach
the Danube. But they turn back into the steppe,
and miss him again.</p>

<p>Still more unintelligible and extraordinary is the
conduct of Darius. When the Danube has been
crossed he commands the Greeks to break down the
bridge; the crews are to join the army on land. It
would follow from this that Darius thought the
bridge no longer necessary. It was not his intention
therefore to return to the Danube, but to march
round the Black Sea, and over the Caucasus, if indeed
he did not mean to skirt the northern shore of the
Caspian and return home over the Oxus. If this was
his object why did he not avail himself of the
important assistance which the fleet could afford him,
and command it to accompany the march of the army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
along the northern shore of the Black Sea? It would
then have brought provisions to the army, or to the
mouths of the rivers, and supported any attacks on the
Greek cities of these coasts; on Tyras at the mouth of
the Dniester, on Ordessus on the Teligul, on Olbia at
the mouth of the Bug, and Panticapaeum on the
Cimmerian Bosphorus. To leave the attack on the
Greek cities to the Greek ships only would be
dangerous, but there was no danger in giving them
a share in it if the main point was to strengthen the
army on land. But Darius wished neither to use
the fleet, nor to allow the bridge to stand, which is
the more remarkable as the bridges on the Bosphorus
were not removed but allowed to remain, obviously
under the protection of Greek men-of-war. At the
Danube Darius has to be informed for the first time
by a Greek that a way must be left open for his
return. Nevertheless he does not order the Greeks
to keep the bridge till further notice, or till his return.
For sixty days only after his departure does he leave
the means for his return open; so long the bridge is
to remain; when that time has expired, the fleet is to
sail away. What interest had Darius in allowing the
Greeks to depart home as quickly as possible? In
order to fix this period of time, he gives the leader of
the Greeks a thong with sixty knots. The calendars
of the Persians and Greeks were different; there were
variations in the calendars of the Aeolians, Ionians, and
Dorians; but sixty days could have been fixed without
a strap and knots. Beyond the Danube Darius
blindly follows the division of Scopasis, wherever it
leads him away to the east and north as far as the
Volga. On what did the army of Darius subsist&mdash;and
it numbered 700,000 men, or if we include the
train, it reached a total of about a million&mdash;for more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
than two months in a country in which, according to
Herodotus' own statement, there was no tilled land
except at the mouths of the Bug and Dnieper, and in
which the advancing Scythians had destroyed the
wells and pastures, as Herodotus asserts? How did the
Persians cross the Tyras (Dniester), Hypanis (Bug),
Borysthenes (Dnieper), and the Tanais (Don)? From
whence did they procure the wood for the bridges or
rafts for crossing them, in the steppe which Herodotus
rightly describes as entirely without wood down to
the forests on the southern edge? Whence came the
water for man and beast in the waterless desert?
When Darius had crossed the Don Herodotus represents
him as building eight large fortresses beyond
the river on the bank of the Volga, the object of
which it is impossible to discover; and in a space of
a little more than two months he represents the
Persian army as not only building these forts but
marching round the whole territory of Scythia, which
in his description extends for 500 miles from the
mouth of the Danube to the mouth of the Don, and
an equal distance northwards into the land, and even
far beyond it. Darius marches as far as the Volga
on the east, and northwards to the desert which lies
beyond the Sarmatians (whose territory extends for
fifteen days' journey up the Don),<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and also beyond
the Budini, "a great and numerous people," and
the Geloni (p. 275). From this point he returns,
according to Herodotus, through the territory of the
northern neighbours of the Scythians to the west,
as far as the lake out of which the Tyras (Dniester)
rises, till the Scythians, who are a day's march
in advance of the Persians, reach the land of the
Agathyrsi.  According to Herodotus' reckoning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the distances, Darius traversed a journey of about
a hundred days' marches of twenty-five miles each,
in less than fifty days. If Herodotus allows the
region of the Scoloti to extend too far to the
north, if on the Dnieper it reached only to the
rapids of the stream, where the tombs of the Scythian
kings lay, the distance, on the other hand, from
the mouth of the Danube to the Don, on which
the Scoloti and the Sarmatians bordered, and which
Darius is said to have crossed, was far greater than
Herodotus assumes; it is at least 750 miles, and
from the mouth of the Danube to the Volga at least
900 miles, which on the route taken by Darius could
not possibly have been traversed both ways in eighty
or ninety days. Herodotus does not allow Darius
even this space of time. According to his account,
the march of Darius to the desert, which separates the
land of the Budini and Geloni on the north from the
Thyssagetae, to the bank of the Volga, the building of
the castles, the return from this point to the borders
of the Agathyrsi and the lake from which the Dnieper
springs, did not occupy sixty days. It is in this
region that the Scythians resolve to retire no farther,
but to attack the Persians daily, when they begin
to cook their food in a land barren of wood, and
they send Scopasis from this point to the Danube.
Scopasis reaches the river before the expiration of
the sixty days for which Darius has bidden the
Ionians wait; indeed, the Scythians of Idanthyrsus
occasionally surrender flocks to the army of Darius,
in order that the Persians may not think of retiring,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in order to keep them in Scythia till the sixty days
are at an end. Impossible as all these marches are,
especially in the short space which Herodotus allots
to them, the conduct of Darius is more impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
still. He advances beyond the Don as far as
the Volga, in order to build fortresses which he
does not complete; from this point he marches back
again after the Scythians as far as the sources of the
Dniester in order to bring on a conflict. At last they
draw out for battle; Darius has attained the object
he so greatly desired. Then follows the hunting of
the hare by the Scythians, and Darius determines to
march away rapidly in the same night to the Danube;
"because the Scythians held them in contempt."
He fortunately reached the bridge by taking the road
on which he had come, but the Scythians assume that
as the wells had been stopped up and the pastures
destroyed, he could not come by that route. But
how could the Persians, who when advancing had
marched to the north-east to the Don, strike out
the same path on their return, upon which they
started on the borders of Transylvania, and the
sources of the Tyras (Dniester)?</p>

<p>The course of affairs must have been widely different.
As Darius allowed the bridge over the Bosphorus to
remain, and left the fleet on the Danube, it cannot
have been his fixed purpose to coast round the Black
Sea. But in any case he must preserve his communications
with Asia and Persia and support his army.
All the sick, or wounded, or unserviceable men in the
army, and all the messengers could only be sent back
over the bridge on the Danube. The crews of the
fleet were the rear-guard of the army, maintaining
and defending its communications. It had also to
provide for its own maintenance, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for the needs of
more than 100,000 men, and no doubt it likewise collected
the provisions for the army by land. However
great the stores which the army brought with it,
they would soon be consumed in the steppe, unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
supplemented. Wherever Darius marched, he could
not venture, with the enormous mass of men and
animals in his army, to go more than a few days'
march at the most from the river-courses. The idea
of retiring before the enemy naturally occurred to a
people who were without a settled habitation, who
wandered in hordes through fixed districts of pasture,
living on the backs of their horses, and carrying their
women and children with them in waggons drawn by
oxen (III. 234). What had they to lose, and what
could they fear from the Persians, if the unarmed,
the women, children, servants, and herds, had already
been sent at the right time under safe convoys far
into the interior towards the neighbouring nations?&mdash;if
all the men&mdash;and the Scoloti were not a numerous
nation<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>&mdash;collected together, and accustomed as they
were to abstinence, and living in continual movement,
advancing far more lightly and rapidly on their
steppe-horses than their encumbered opponents,
hovered round their enemy, stopped up wells and
destroyed pastures, without ever engaging in battle?
If the Scythians were wise, they would not retire to
the east, where Darius could approach the coast,
and bring up his fleet with auxiliaries, but away
from the sea, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the north. If the Scythians
were not terrified by the enormous power of Darius,
and knew how to avoid battles, the army of Darius
would soon be ruined by its own numbers in the
desert.</p>

<p>As a fact this is the way in which the war beyond
the Danube seems to have been carried on. Herodotus
tells us that Darius came upon the Scythians three
marches beyond the Danube. If he found their
forces united, he must have hoped to engage them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
a battle which would have decided the campaign at
one stroke in his favour. But these mounted opponents
could not be captured, Darius sinks deeper and deeper
into the desert, till he is compelled by distress to
return, and his retreat was made an occasion of heavy
losses by the light-armed Scythians.</p>

<p>In the excerpt from the narrative of Trogus preserved
by Justin, which may have been derived
from Deinon's "Persian History," we are told: "The
Scythians drove back Darius the king of the Persians
in shameful flight. When Iancyrus (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Idanthyrsus),
the king of the Scythians, had refused to give his
daughter in marriage to Darius, Darius made war upon
him, and invaded Scythia with 700,000 soldiers. As
the Scythians gave him no opportunity of battle, he
retreated in great anxiety lest the bridge over the
Danube should be broken in his rear, after losing
80,000 men. Owing to the abundance of men this
loss was not considered a disaster."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> In Ctesias the
king of the Scythians is called Scytharbes. "Darius
collected an army of 800,000 men, bridged the
Bosphorus and the Danube, marched into Scythia, and
penetrated for a distance of fifteen days. Scytharbes
and Darius sent each other the gift of a bow. As the
bow of the Scythian was the stronger, Darius retired
over the bridge and broke it up, before the whole army
had passed over. Those who were left behind, 80,000
men in number, were cut down by Scytharbes. Darius
crossed the bridge over the Bosphorus, and burnt the
houses and the temples of Chalcedon, because the
Chalcedonians had attempted to destroy the bridge,
and had thrown down the altar which Darius had set
up at the crossing."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Strabo remarks: "At the
mouths of the Danube there is a large island, Peuce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
The mouths are seven in number, and the largest is
called the sacred mouth; the distance to Peuce by
this is 120 stadia; above the lower part of this
mouth Darius built the bridge; it might have been
bridged on the upper part also. It is the first if
you take the left hand when sailing into Pontus; the
rest follow in the voyage to Tyras. On the Pontic
Sea, from the Danube to the Tyras (Dniester) is the
desert of the Getae, a vast waterless plain. When
Darius, the son of Hystaspes, crossed the Ister, to
march against the Scythians, he was in danger of
perishing by thirst with his whole army through
being cut off in this desert; but he discovered his
danger just in time, and returned.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> For the support
of the camel which had best sustained with him the
weariness of the journey through the desert of Scythia,
and had carried the baggage with the provisions
of the king, he apportioned the hamlet of Gaugamela
in Assyria," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> its income and tribute, or natural
products.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The level desert of Strabo, between the
Danube and the Dniester, includes Moldavia as far
as the eastern slopes of the mountains of Transylvania,
Bessarabia, and Podolia. Herodotus also represents
the decisive charge in the campaign as taking place
in the neighbourhood of the Agathyrsi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the inhabitants
of Transylvania. Ctesias tells us that Darius had
marched fifteen days beyond the Danube. Reckoning
a day's march at 25 miles, as Herodotus does, Darius
would thus have advanced 75 miles to the north of the
Danube, with which the assertion of Herodotus agrees,
that the Scoloti retired before Darius to the border of
the land of the Agathyrsi, and the lake out of which
the Tyras rises, but no further. By the lake out of
which the Tyras rises we can hardly understand the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
lakes at Lemberg, for Darius could scarcely have come
so far to the west. The marshes at the source of the
Bug are probably meant, which as the crow flies are
325 miles from Reni, on the Danube. If the Scoloti
ventured to retire but a little way from the river
courses, the Persians retired still less. Hence the
retreat of the Scythians and the advance of Darius
must have proceeded up the Pruth, through Bessarabia
to Podolia as far as the marshes on the upper
Dniester in which the Bug rises, where Herodotus
represents the two armies as encamping opposite
each other, or as far as the marshes of the Prypet.
The answer which Herodotus puts in the mouth of
Idanthyrsus&mdash;that Darius should attack the tombs of
the kings (on the rapids of the Dniester) and then the
Scythians would fight, has a meaning, if Darius was
far from the centre of Scythia, and the message was
sent to him when in the neighbourhood of the source
of the Bug or the Prypet; it was without meaning if
he had already traversed the whole land of Scythia as
far as the Don and the Volga. Want of provisions
for man and beast far more than the want of water
would have compelled him to return. Had the
Scythians previously surrounded the army of Darius
on all sides, they would have thrown themselves with
impunity in full force on his rear when retreating. If
everything left behind through weariness and sickness
had fallen into their hands, they would now not merely
hinder the retreat but greatly endanger it. As soon
as the communications with the Danube were completely
closed (Strabo tells us that Darius was cut off
in the desert of the Getae), Darius must have been in
alarm whether the fidelity of the tyrants or their
desire to maintain their position in their own cities
was strong enough to keep them at the bridge, and if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
this were the case whether they could induce their
crews to remain.</p>

<p>Such in its essential outlines must have been the
course of the campaign of Darius beyond the Danube.
What Herodotus tells us are legends of the Scythians,
which he had heard with some additions from his
fellow-countrymen, in Ordessus and Olbia. It was the
greatest glory of the Scythians not to have succumbed
to this attack; no doubt they placed in the most
brilliant light the cunning and endurance of their
fathers, which brought about this result. We must
remove from the series of events the meeting of the
barbarians, the assistance of the Geloni, Budini, and
Sarmatians, the entire eastern part of the story, no
less than the march through the whole of Scythia.
That story has no doubt arisen from the supposed
object of it&mdash;the assumed eight fortresses of Darius on
the Volga, the remains of which were in existence in
Herodotus' time. These unfinished citadels were either
fortifications of some tribe or another, long since
abandoned, or ancient tumuli, such as are still frequently
found in the steppes above the Black Sea.
Some were said to be trenches of the Cimmerians and
others trenches of Darius. It was these which gave the
direction to the march of Darius. Besides tradition from
Greece and Scythia we have isolated traces of Iranian
poetry in the accounts of Herodotus, Justin, and
Ctesias. To these belong the suit of Darius for the
daughter of the king of the Scythians and his refusal,
the sending of the bow, and the enigmatical gifts of
the Scythians, of which Gobryas could interpret the
meaning. Other Greeks could mention the names of
different persons who had guessed this riddle.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>A peculiar concatenation of circumstances had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
placed in the hands of the princes of the Greeks of
Anatolia the fortune of the Persian army, and with it
the fortune of the Persian monarchy and the entire
Persian empire. If they left Darius to his fate, removed
the bridge, and sailed home with their ships,
it would be almost impossible for the Persian king
and army to cross the Danube, and the Greek cities
would have been free from any foreign dominion.
As soon as Darius was at a distance from the bridge,
the Scythians must have called upon the Greeks to
depart, and they must have repeated their request
more urgently when they had cut off Darius's connection
with the bridge and intercepted his retreat; they
would represent his position to be as desperate as
possible. Without doubt Histiaeus of Miletus was
commander of the fleet. Not once only, as Herodotus
represents, but every day Histiaeus, on whom the
greatest responsibility rested, must have discussed with
his associates the question of remaining or departing,
when it was clear that Darius was in danger, and
there could not be a doubt that the Scythians were
pressing hard upon him, and perhaps cutting off his
return.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> But there was only one among the tyrants
of the Greeks who firmly represented the view that
they ought to abandon the king. This was Miltiades
of Chersonesus, one of the newest vassals of Persia,
who had not been raised to the throne by Darius, but
only confirmed in his hereditary principality. The
opposite view, according to Herodotus, was heard from
the mouth of Histiaeus. It showed how correct was
the calculation of Cyrus, when, in order to secure the
obedience of the Greek states, he had made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
elevation of princes in them one of his principles.
There is no doubt that the princes could now have
put an end to the dominion of the Persians, but at
the same time they would have put an end to their
own power; they would have annihilated themselves
with the king of the Persians. The large majority
of the tyrants, so we are told in Nepos, joined in
the opinion of Histiaeus. We can with certainty
assume that those of the tyrants who subsequently
received peculiar marks of distinction from Darius;
Histiaeus of Miletus, Hippoclus of Lampsacus, Coes,
the leader of the ships of Lesbos, contributed in
some essential manner to the retention of the fleet;
that it was chiefly they who kept back the others,
and above all the crews. But even those tyrants
who maintained most strongly that the post entrusted
to them should be kept, could not prevent
the possibility that the Persians might be detained
in the desert; that Darius might not return. In this
uncertain and wavering position (Darius remained
longer than was expected and thus many people thought
him lost), the last decision would be deferred for a
certain time, and the crews would be calmed by a
promise not to wait for Darius beyond a certain
period. The same reply might be made to the
demands of the Scythians in order not to ruin their
cause with them should they really destroy the army
of the Persians. In the other event Darius might
be told that the period was merely fixed in order
to keep the Scythians away from the bridge. From
such a period, which the princes fixed for themselves
and their crews, may have arisen the legend of the
command of Darius, that they were to wait for sixty
days&mdash;a story which was afterwards quoted by the
Greeks against the tyrants to the effect that they not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
only faithfully carried out the commands of Darius,
but had gone beyond them to rescue him. As a fact
Darius must have spent far more than sixty days
beyond the Danube if he advanced fifteen full days'
marches, according to the reckoning of Herodotus, and
penetrated to the sources of the Dniester, the Bug, or
the Prypet. For an army like that of Darius could
not march more than ten miles a day, and thus the
750 miles of advance and retreat, which in the latter
part would have been traversed amid continual encounters,
required at least eighty or ninety days.
The Ionians had remained, though they had not kept
all the contingents with them. The ships of Antandros
and Lamponium, and no doubt those of other cities
also, had sailed away of their own accord.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>How great soever the losses may have been which
the army of Darius suffered in Scythia&mdash;the number,
80,000, which Ctesias represents as perishing by the
premature destruction of the bridge, and which Justin
represents as the entire sum of the losses of the army,
appears to have been the official amount of the loss
among the Persians&mdash;when the Danube was crossed,
they found security and provisions, rest and refreshment.
The Scythians could not force a passage
against the ships of war, which controlled the
stream, and the land army of the Persians. Undisturbed
by them, Darius could now have made better arrangements
for continuing the war beyond the Danube,
and preparing for the conduct of it, if unexpected
events had not compelled him to complete his retreat
in haste. Ctesias told us above that the Chalcedonians,
on whose territory lay the Asiatic end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
bridge, had attempted to break it down. Strabo
relates that Darius burned the cities round the
Propontis and Abydus because he was afraid that
they might supply the Scythians with transports to
Asia.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Herodotus tells us, that Darius, on his return
from the Danube, marched through Thrace into the
land of the Hellespontians; thence he crossed on the
ships to Asia, and then repaired himself to Sardis,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
leaving behind Megabyzus as general in the land of
the Hellespontians, who reduced by force of arms
those who did not "medize."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> With the Persians who
remained in Europe he first attacked the Perinthians
"who would not submit to Darius;" the Perinthians
fought bravely for their freedom, but the numbers of
the Persians were overpowering.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But Otanes, the
son of Sisamnes, to whom Darius entrusted the command
by sea, took Byzantium, Chalcedon, Antandros,
and Lamponium. The reason for enslaving and subjugating
these cities, was that he charged some of
them with abandoning the army on the march against
the Scythians, and others with injuring the army on
its return. The latter charge would apply chiefly to
Byzantium and Chalcedon.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> It follows further from
the narrative of Herodotus, that Darius awaited the
result of the action of Megabyzus and Otanes at
Sardis, and did not return to Persia till Megabyzus
had penetrated to the west into Thracia, and he had
established his brother Artaphernes as satrap at Sardis.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
Of the Scythians Herodotus tells us that they pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>sued
Darius with their united forces as far as the
Thracian Chersonese; Miltiades did not venture to
await their arrival there but fled, till the Scythians
had retired and the Doloncians had brought him back.
Next, in order to punish Darius for his invasion
of their land, the Scythians sent an embassy to
Sparta, in order to call upon the Spartans to cross
over to Ephesus, while they attacked Media from the
Phasis.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>From this we conclude that a serious rebellion of
the Greek cities on both shores of the straits and the
Propontis broke out in the rear of Darius; that the
cities thought Darius lost, or intended to prevent his
return. Byzantium rebelled, though the tyrant Ariston
was at the river with the fleet of the city; so also
Abydus, whose tyrant Daphnis was likewise there with
his fleet. Besides these cities, Perinthus, Chalcedon,
Antandrus, and Lamponium, on the Ionian coast, are
expressly mentioned as rebels. Strabo speaks generally
of the cities round the Propontis in this sense.
Herodotus tells us that Chalcedon was taken, and
Ctesias that it was burnt. According to the latter
the Chalcedonians were eager to destroy the bridge;
but Darius was nevertheless able to pass it. Herodotus
asserts that Darius passed on the ships from
Sestus into Asia, and that the Scythians pursued him
as far as the Thracian Chersonesus. This definite
and double statement on the direction of the return
march, and the passage of Darius into Asia, must be
maintained against the inexact excerpt from Ctesias.
If the bridge lay over the Bosphorus, Darius certainly
did not march to the Hellespont.</p>

<p>The course of events was this. When he arrived
on the northern side of the Danube Darius perceived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
that a part of the Greek ships had sailed homeward,
that the communications with Asia were interrupted,
that the bridge had been broken, that the cities on
both shores of the straits were in rebellion. He was
compelled to send the fleet at once to the straits in
order to reopen communications. As Byzantium and
Chalcedon could throw great difficulties in the way of
any communication or passage over the Bosphorus, the
fleet was bidden to open the Hellespont and keep it
open. When the fleet was dismissed it was no longer
possible to keep the army on the Danube; and besides
it was imperative to bring the rebellious cities to obedience
at once, a duty which could not be left merely to
their fellow-countrymen who had remained faithful in
the fleet. So Darius must have led the army to the
Hellespont as soon as he had allowed time for rest
on the Danube. The Scythians no doubt crossed the
river when they saw the army of Darius leave the bank,
and well-mounted hordes followed the retreating army
on the south of the Danube in order to make booty, to
carry off the baggage, and cut down the stragglers.
But there was no serious pursuit. The Scythians could
not have undertaken this against the Persians; and
if they had undertaken it and threatened danger,
Darius would not have sent a part of the army to
Asia. He must then have turned his whole force upon
the Scythians. Miltiades certainly did not retire before
the Scythians but before the Persians. Even if he
had gone no farther than expressing his wish, and had
not left the Danube with his ships,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>&mdash;though he had
not found means for embarrassing the retreat of the
Persians over the Hellespont, yet in the eyes of the
Persians he was the author of the revolt, his vote in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the council of war at the Danube was obviously
treacherous, and the beginning which gave impulse to
the mischief. Miltiades then retired to the Thracians.
He had married the daughter of Olorus, a Thracian
prince. Twelve years later the general revolt of the
Greek states gave him the means of returning to his
principality. The embassy of the Scythians to Sparta
seems no more than a fable of the Spartans, which
belongs to the obscure side of the history of
Cleomenes.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Hellespont, Darius allowed a part
of the army under Megabyzus to remain on the
European shore for the purpose of besieging Perinthus
and the other cities on that coast, with the rest he
passed on the raft to the Asiatic side: the conduct of
sieges was no task for a king. But he wished to
remain at Sardis in the neighbourhood till the rebels
were punished, the passage secured, and till the
auxiliaries for the army of Megabyzus and their
communications were settled. Otanes, the son of
Sisamnes, received the command on the Asiatic
shore; he besieged and destroyed Abydus, reduced
the cities on the Trojan coast, on the southern shore
of the Propontis, and then turned against Chalcedon
and Byzantium, while in the mean time Megabyzus
had besieged and taken Perinthus and the cities on
the northern coast of the Propontis. The campaign
against the Scythians was not to remain without results;
Darius could not allow himself to set foot in Europe
for nothing. When only Chalcedon and Byzantium
remained unconquered, Otanes received the command
over the troops on both shores, and Megabyzus was
commanded to make the tribes of the Thracians on
the west as far as the Strymon subjects of the
Persian king. Chalcedon was the first to fall after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
a protracted siege. The exiles from Chalcedon and
Byzantium founded Mesembria.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

Herodotus the campaign against Samos is contemporaneous with the
rebellion of the Babylonians (3, 150). If Darius had had armies at
his disposal from Samos there, he would not have needed to send
Bagaeus. The expedition to Samos must be placed after the end of
the rebellion, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> at the earliest in the year 517, and it cannot be put
later than a year at the least before the Scythian expedition, since the
ships of Samos, led by Syloson's son, take part in that expedition,
and in addition to Samos the cities of the Bosphorus are in the hands
of the Persians before that event. The expedition to investigate the
shores of Greece, in which Democedes took part, is placed by Herodotus
before the attack upon Scythia. This is improbable, because the
experience which Darius gained in the Scythian expedition, and which
made it seem desirable to put the command in Persian hands, preceded
this expedition. There is nothing to point to it before the
expedition; it first becomes intelligible when Darius had resolved to
change his plan of conquests in the north for conquests in the west,
and had given Megabyzus orders to subjugate the coasts of Thracia
on the &AElig;gean,&mdash;when Megabyzus had advanced to the Strymon
and Macedonia had recognised the sovereignty of Persia. On the
other hand, the investigation of the Greek coasts cannot be put much
later than 512, since Milo of Crotona, who is still of great influence
in that region, as Herodotus himself remarks (3, 137), betroths his
daughter to Democedes. This influence Milo retained only as far as
the year 510 or 509; for soon after the victory over Sybaris and the
destruction of the city, which took place 511 or 510 <small>B.C.</small>, the rising
against Pythagoras and the aristocracy took place; they were overthrown
and expelled. In Herodotus the Scythian expedition comes after
the capture of Babylon (4, 1). We have seen from the inscriptions
(p. 254), that there were two rebellions of Babylon, and that they
cannot have come to an end before the close of the year 517. Now
Samos was subjugated before this Scythian expedition; moreover
Byzantium and the Chersonese must have been in the hands of the
Persians; at least a year must have been occupied with the preparations
required to bring 700,000 men to the Bosphorus, and with the
preparations for building the bridge (Herod. 3, 83).  Hence the
campaign cannot have commenced before the year 515 <small>B.C.</small> and it
cannot be put later than 510 <small>B.C.</small> Miltiades is already master of the
Chersonese when Darius crosses the Danube; according to Herodotus
it is the Pisistratids (not Hippias) who sent him there. Hence
Miltiades was master of the Chersonese before 514 <small>B.C.</small>, the year in
which Hipparchus was murdered. Again, when Miltiades has to
retire from the Chersonese before the return of Darius, he does not go
to Athens, from which it follows that Hippias was still tyrant in
Athens. Thucydides tells us that when Hippias, after the murder of
Hipparchus, was looking about for alliances he married his daughter
to Aeantides, the son of Hippoclus, tyrant of Lampsacus, because he
saw that Hippoclus was in great repute with Darius. This influence
Hippoclus must have gained in the Scythian expedition; he led the
ships of his city to the Danube and voted for remaining there. Hence
this expedition must be put some time before 510 <small>B.C.</small> If we allow
two years for the battles of Megabyzus in Thrace, and the march of
Bubares to Macedonia after the Scythian war, and place, as is natural,
the expedition to the coasts of Hellas, which falls in the year 512 <small>B.C.</small>,
after these acquisitions, we might keep to the year 515 for the Scythian
expeditions. But as the Indian conquests precede the Scythian war,
the year 513 <small>B.C.</small> seems still better. The expedition to Barca is, in
Herodotus, contemporaneous with the conflicts of Megabyzus against
those "who were not of Median opinions" (4, 145). This contemporaneous
date is supported by the fact that Greek ships only, and
not Phenician, are ordered to the Danube, and to support the communications
of Megabyzus with Asia,&mdash;a circumstance which is best
explained by the absence of the Phenicians in the African expedition.
Moreover, Justin (19, 1) speaks of an embassy of Darius to Carthage
at the time when this city was engaged in a conflict with Doreus of
Sicily (Herod. 5, 45-48; 7, 165; Diod. 4, 23). Such an embassy,
which could only be sent to demand a recognition of supremacy or
union in war against the Greeks, was first suggested when the
Persians reached as far as the Euhesperides and Persia became a
neighbour of Carthage, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> after the expedition to Barca. The colony
of Dorieus on the Eryx was planted between 510 and 508; he had
previously taken part in the battle on the Traeis in 311 or 510 <small>B.C.</small>
The embassy of Darius to Carthage would therefore be subsequent
to the campaign to Barca and the expedition of Democedes, and the
years 513 and 512 seem most suitable for the first.  From the
inscriptions of Darius it is clear that the inscription of Persepolis,
when compared with the inscription of Behistun, enumerates more
subject lands. The former speaks of the Ionians of the continent and
the Ionians of the sea (<i>daraya</i>), while the inscription of Behistun
merely mentions the Ionians. By the Ionians of the sea we are to
understand the newly-subjugated Greeks of Samos, the Greek cities
on the Bosphorus and Propontis. Moreover, the inscription of Persepolis,
as already mentioned, speaks of Idhus (p. 260), while the inscription
of Behistun speaks of Gandaras only. It follows from this that the
first undertakings of Darius after crushing the rebellion were the wars
in the east, the conquests of Samos and the Greek cities on the straits.
This is established by the statement of Herodotus that the Indians
were included in the first division into satrapies&mdash;which he places soon
after the accession of Darius&mdash;but the islands and the Thracians
were added later on. The palace at Persepolis must therefore have
been built about the year 515 <small>B.C.</small> after the war upon the Indians and
the expedition to Samos, after the subjugation of the strait, but
before the campaigns against Scythia and Barca. The Scythian
campaign falls in the year 513, the conquests of Megabyzus and
Otanes in 512, the campaign against Barca in 513 and 512, the
expedition for the investigation of the Greek coasts in 512 or
511. The inscription on the tomb of Darius does not mention Ionians
of the continent and Ionians of the sea, but Ionians merely in
one case, and then <i>Yauna takabara</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Ionians who wore locks, by
whom may be meant the Greeks of Lemnos and Imbros, the Greek
cities of the Thracian coast, and the Macedonians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the regions
which were first subjugated after the Scythian campaign. It will be
made clear below that the last names in the inscription on the
tomb are to be explained of African tribes, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the result of the
expedition against Barca. By the &Ccedil;kudra, mentioned on the inscription,
we may understand the Thracians; in the place of the &Ccedil;aka who
are mentioned without any addition at Behistun and Persepolis, the
sepulchral inscription has three kinds of &Ccedil;aka:&mdash;<i>&Ccedil;aka humavarka</i>,
who must be interpreted to mean the Amyrgian Sacae of Herodotus;
<i>&Ccedil;aka tigrakhauda</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Sacae with pointed caps; and finally <i>&Ccedil;aka
taradaraya</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Sacae beyond the sea, who must be the Scoloti.</p></div>

The altar of Zeus Diabaterius which, according to
Ctesias, Darius erects, and the Chalcedonians subsequently pull down,
is certainly identical with the two monuments which, according to
Herodotus, Darius set up at Byzantium (above, p. 269). Herodotus also
speaks of the destruction of the monuments, but ascribes it to the
Byzantines. This was done obviously in the time after the battle of
Mycale; if previously destroyed they would have been restored by
Megabyzus and Otanes when they subjugated the Hellespont. Of
the later destruction Herodotus relates that the Byzantines conveyed
the stones into the city, and used them in building the altar of Artemis
Orthosia; one stone only, covered with Assyrian letters, was left at the
temple of Dionysus: Herod. 4, 87.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE CONQUESTS IN AFRICA AND EUROPE.</h3>


<p>Like Bactria and Arachosia, Asia Minor and Egypt
had remained loyal, when the natives in the centre
of the kingdom, the Semites and Arians, and even
the Persians, had revolted against Darius. In Egypt
Aryandes, who had been appointed satrap by Cambyses,
still held his office. Uzahorsun, the Egyptian
whom Cambyses had placed in his retinue and taken
into his service (p. 171), tells us, "that his holiness,
the king of upper and lower Egypt, Darius (Ntariush),
the ever-living, had commanded him to go to Egypt,
when his holiness was in Elam, when he became
lord of the whole world, the great king of Egypt."
According to the commands of his holiness he (Uzahorsun)
had restored order in Egypt and had received
contributions from all. No one had spoken evil
of him, for he had given to every one what was justly
his; he had restored all men to their rights, and
had placed them in the boundaries of their property
as it had been marked out; the worship of the gods
and their habitations had been restored according
to the will of his holiness; the offerings had been
brought, the festivals had been celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>  In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
addition to the toleration which the Ach&aelig;menids
always extended to the religion of the nations subject
to them, though it was not their own religion,
and the care which they took of their places of
worship, Darius seems to have been at especial pains
to win the affections of the Egyptians. His intention
was, no doubt, to make Egypt the starting-point for
further enterprise in Africa, and the support of the
conquests which he had in contemplation. Herodotus
tells us that when Darius determined to erect
his statue before the temple of Ptah at Memphis, he
gave way before the opposition of the priest of the
temple. Diodorus tells us that the Egyptians consider
Darius as their sixth law-giver, after Menes, Sasychis,
Sesosis, Bocchoris, and Amasis. Darius had mixed with
the Egyptian priests, and had thus become acquainted
with their theology, and the magnanimity and devotion
of their ancient kings. He set them before him
as a pattern, and for this reason he was so highly
honoured among the Egyptians that even in his
life-time he was considered a god, and after his death
he received the honours which in ancient days had
been given to the kings of Egypt, whose reigns had
been most in accordance with law. The name of
Darius meets us frequently on the buildings of Egypt.
A long inscription in the stone quarries at Hamamat
informs us that an Egyptian architect, Chnum-ab-rha,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
who had already been in the service of Amasis, was
in the service of Darius from the 26th to the 30th
year of his reign, and carried out his various buildings.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
The Apis which had appeared in the fifth year of
Cambyses (p. 171), died in the fourth year of Darius
(518 <small>B.C.</small>), and was buried in the necropolis of Memphis,
in the sanctuary of Osiris-Apis, in the front
space of the gallery of the tombs of Apis, which
Psammetichus had added to the gallery of Ramses II.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
Another great work which Darius undertook in connection
with the monuments of the ancient Pharaohs,
besides the advantages which it conferred on the trade
of the whole kingdom and the intercourse between
the parts of it, must have been of the very greatest
value to Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>From the valley of the Nile, to which Darius
devoted such attention, in the autumn of the same
year in which he marched to the Danube, a second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Persian expedition set forth, comprising both an army
and a fleet&mdash;a great armament, as Herodotus says,
which was intended to establish and extend the
dominion of the Persian kingdom on the north coast
of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The Libyan tribes which inhabited these
deserts on the borders of Egypt, like the great cities
Cyrene and Barca, had paid homage to Cambyses, had
sent presents, and agreed to pay tribute.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Barca had
been founded by Cyrene about 30 years before the
conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, and was governed
by a branch of the Battiadae, the royal house of
Cyrene. The daughter of the prince of Barca, whom
Herodotus, following no doubt the Libyan name
for the royal title, calls Alazeir, was the wife of
Archelaus III. of Cyrene, who for reasons known
to us had submitted to Cambyses. More than ten
years afterwards, Archelaus repaired to his father-in-law
at Barca; during his absence his mother Pheretima
was to govern Cyrene. While at Barca, he
was murdered together with his father-in-law Alazeir
by certain Cyrenaeans who had fled to that city to
escape the cruelty with which he had re-established his
sway in Cyrene (p. 153), and by the people of Barca.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
His mother, who was no longer in any position to
maintain her power in Cyrene, fled to Egypt and
besought assistance from Aryandes; "in return for
her fidelity to Persia, her son had been slain." Aryandes
sympathised with her distress, so Herodotus
tells us, and put at her disposal the whole force in
Egypt, both the army and the fleet; sympathy with
Pheretima was the reason of the campaign of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Persians against Barca. He adds that in his own
opinion this was merely a pretext; the real object
was the subjugation of the Libyans, of whom a few
only were the subjects of Darius.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>By the assassination of the two princes who had
submitted to Persia the word for revolt was given,
and the more plainly because the Barc&aelig;ans, according
to Herodotus, refused to give up the murderers.
The land round Cyrene was extraordinarily
fertile, and the district of Barca reached on the west to
the great Syrtis. The army which set out to reduce
a city, 600 miles distant from Memphis, was led by
a Persian, Amasis of the tribe of the Maraphians.
(V. 323). This march along the north coast through
regions partly desert and partly inhabited by nomads,
was to be supported by a fleet formed no doubt of
Phenician and Egyptian ships, under the command of
Badres of the tribe of the Pasargadae. The Persians
reached the extensive and well-watered mountain
plain which formed the territory of Barca. The city
was invested, but the Barc&aelig;ans made a vigorous
resistance.  Furious attacks of the Persians were
repulsed, and even their attempt to carry mines under
the city miscarried. A smith in Barca, according to
Herodotus, discovered the direction of the mines by
placing a brazen shield upon the ground, inside the
wall, and striking it,&mdash;the soil being hollow, wherever
the shield resounded. Then the Barc&aelig;ans dug
shafts and killed the workmen of the enemy in their
passages.  After nine months of fruitless efforts
Amasis was convinced that he could not take the
place by storm. He offered to abandon the siege if
the Barc&aelig;ans would pay a suitable tribute to the
king; so long as they fulfilled this condition the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Persians would not take up arms against them. The
conditions were sworn to on both sides, as Herodotus
tells us, in the form that they "should be kept so
long as the earth remained." But on the previous
night Amasis had excavated the place on which the
oath was sworn, had covered the excavation with
wood, and placed earth upon the wood. When the
Barcaeans, in reliance on the truce, opened the gates,
came out of their city and permitted the Persians to
enter it, Amasis caused the earth to fall in by removing
the wood-work, in order to make the treaty
invalid. Being masters of the city the Persians gave
up to Pheretima those who were chiefly implicated in
the murder of Archelaus. She caused them to be
crucified round the walls of Barca, and at the same
time cut off the breasts of their wives and affixed
them to the walls. The Persians also carried away a
large number of prisoners, in order to weaken the
city, and so to retain it in subjection with less effort.
Only the Battiad&aelig; and a remnant of the population
were left. After thus reducing the city, the Persians
marched through the fruitful plain, which stretches to
the west of Barca between the table-land and the sea,
towards the west. At Euhesperides on the great
Syrtis they reached the extreme point in the west of
Africa to which the Persians ever penetrated.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>"When the army reached Cyrene on its return," so
Herodotus tells us, "the Cyrenaeans in obedience to
an oracle allowed it to pass through the city. While
passing through, Badres, the commander of the fleet,
bade them take the city, but Amasis prevented this,
saying that he was sent out against Barca, and no
other city. When they had marched through, and
the army was encamped on the hill of Zeus Lycaeus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
they repented that they had not seized Carthage, and
attempted to enter the city a second time. But this
the Cyrenaeans would not allow. Then the Persians,
though no one was fighting against them, were seized
with a panic; they ran away about sixty stades and
there encamped till a messenger of Aryandes called
them back. At their request they received provisions
for the journey from the Cyrenaeans and returned to
Egypt. But those who remained behind and delayed
their march were cut down by the Libyans for the
sake of their clothes and armour, till they reached
Egypt. The captive Barc&aelig;ans were sent to the king,
and Darius gave them a village in Bactria for a
habitation to which they gave the name Barca. This
village was inhabited in Bactria down to my time."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>According to this narrative the expedition to Barca,
which set out in the autumn of 513 <small>B.C.</small> and returned
home at the earliest towards the end of 512 <small>B.C.</small> (the
siege of Barca occupied nine months), did not turn out
prosperously for the Persians. The contrary was the
case. Herodotus repeats a legend of the Cyrenaeans,
which was intended to put their courage in a clear
light, and according to which an entrance into the
city when demanded for the third time was refused to
the Persian army which had marched through Cyrene
on its advance and return. Further, an attempted
attack of the Persians failed though there was no
resistance, and Cyrene magnanimously furnished the
Persians with provisions for their journey. The army
and fleet of the Persians, when quartered in the fertile
district of Cyrene, were in a position to supply themselves
abundantly at the cost of the city. Moreover,
we subsequently find a fourth Battus at the head of
Cyrene and Barca, and after him a fourth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Arcesilaus.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> After the murder of Arcesilaus III. a Battiad would
have been the less likely to ascend the throne of
Cyrene without the aid of the Persians, owing to the
cruel punishment which Pheretima had inflicted on
her opponents. Moreover, Herodotus tells us himself
that Darius included the Libyans adjacent to Egypt
as well as Cyrene and Barca in the sixth satrapy, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the satrapy of Egypt, and imposed upon the two a
yearly tribute of 700 talents.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> From other accounts
it is clear that the Libyans of this district, and with
them the inhabitants of the oasis of Ammon, had
to contribute salt to the Persians, and Herodotus
tells us that these Libyans of the north coast, clad
in the skins of animals and armed with poles hardened
in the fire, served in the army of the Persian kings
along with the curly-haired negroes living beyond
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Monuments and inscriptions also prove that
not Cyrene and Barca only, but even the Libyan
tribes of the north coast as far as the great Syrtis,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Adyrmachidae, Giligammae, and Asbystae were
subdued at that time, and that the dominion of
Darius extended as far as the oases on the northern
edge of the desert. Herodotus has already told us of
the oasis Polis, which was situated seven days' journey
from Thebes in the sand (p. 165),&mdash;the modern Oasis
el Charigeh. The inscriptions of the great temple, the
walls of which still exist at this place in tolerable
preservation, tell us that Darius "S-tut-Ra,"<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
rival of the sun, dedicated this temple to Ammon
Ra of Thebes, the lord of Hib (which is the name
of this oasis among the Egyptians). In the colossal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
picture on the exterior wall at the back, Darius offers
sacrifice to this god and the goddess Mut, who stands
behind him; behind the king we also see the goddess
Hathor.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> At a later time Darius Ochus added to this
temple. The inscription of Naksh-i-Rustem, which
distinguishes the tomb of Darius, quotes among the
nations who were his subjects the <i>Putiya</i>, <i>Machiya</i>,
and <i>Kushiya</i>. By the Putiya (Puta in the Babylonian
translation of the inscription) we must understand
beyond doubt the Put of the Hebrews, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
Libyans; the Machiya may be the Maxyes of Herodotus,
to the west of Cyrene, the Mashawasha of the
Egyptians; the Kushiya are the Cushites of the
Egyptians, Hebrews, and Assyrians, the Ethiopians of
the Greeks, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Nubians and negroes beyond Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Justin's excerpt from Pompeius Trogus tells us that
Darius sent an embassy to Carthage with the command
that the Carthaginians must abstain from
human sacrifices and the use of dogs' flesh, burn their
corpses instead of burying them; and at the same
time he bade them furnish auxiliary troops against
the Greeks, whom he intended to attack. The Carthaginians
refused the auxiliary troops because they
were frequently at war with their neighbours; to the
rest of his commands they readily submitted that
they might not seem to be obstinate.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Both the
objects mentioned for the embassy are fictions, though
they show an acquaintance with the Arian religion
and the views of Darius, but there is no reason to
doubt that Darius entered into negotiations with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Carthage. Cambyses had already fixed his eye on
Carthage, and Darius by the expedition to Barca and
Euhesperides, had become the neighbour of the city,
the territory of which reached as far to the east as
the Great Syrtis. In common opposition to the
Greeks the interests of Carthage and Darius were
united, for the Greek navy was the rival of the
Phenicians and Carthaginians, and the Carthaginians
were in conflict with the Greek cities in Sicily. In
Justin's account the embassy of Darius came to Carthage
at the time when the Carthaginians in Sicily were
in conflict with Dorieus. Their struggle to prevent
the settlement on Eryx fell between the years 510
and 508 <small>B.C.</small> The expedition against Barca came to
an end as we saw in the year 512 <small>B.C.</small> Hence the
negotiations between Persia and Carthage must have
followed upon this expedition.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>While the Persians in the south of the Mediterranean
were advancing to the west along the coast of
Africa, the army of Megabyzus moved along the north
in the same direction (512 <small>B.C.</small>). Perinthus and the
cities on the northern shore of the Propontis were
reduced and punished, and then Darius gave orders,
according to Herodotus, for the reduction of Thrace.
"And Megabyzus marched through Thrace, and reduced
every nation and every city into submission
to the king. The nation of the Thracians is the
greatest after the Indians, and if it were united or
governed by one man, it would be invincible, and in
my opinion the strongest of all nations. But as this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
is impossible, and can never be brought about, they
are weak. They buy their wives at a high price
from their parents and sell the children into foreign
countries. They regard it as the greatest degradation
to till the field, as most honourable to do nothing,
as most noble to live by war and plunder. It is a
mark of birth to be tatooed, and of low origin to have
no print upon the skin. The rich lay out their dead
for three days; first they mourn for them, then they
slay victims of every kind and make a feast, burn
the corpse or bury it, heap up a mound, and celebrate
games of all kinds, in which, as is right, the greatest
prizes are put up for the victors. They worship only
Ares, Dionysus, and Artemis; but their kings also
specially worship Hermes from whom they claim to
be descended. Of this territory Megabyzus subjugated
the whole strip, which lay on the sea, to
Darius." The Paeonians, who were settled on the
Strymon and round Lake Prasias, assembled on their
coast to await the attack. But Megabyzus turned
into the inland region to the north of Mount Pangaeum,
and from that direction fell unexpectedly
upon the cities of the Paeonians, which were undefended.
Then each of the Paeonians hastened back
to his family and they submitted to the Persians, and
Megabyzus caused the Paeonians on the Siris, and
the Paeoplians, who were situated to the north of
Pangaeum, on the Strymon, to be carried captive
to Sardis to the king. "But the Paeonians who
dwelt on Mount Pangaeum, and on piles in Lake
Prasias, were not at first subjugated by Megabyzus,
though he made the attempt."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Together with the tribes of the Thracians, the
numerous cities of the Greeks on this coast became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
subjects of Darius.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Doriscus on the mouth of the
Hebrus received a Persian garrison.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> In vain the
inhabitants of Teos, more than thirty years previously,
had emigrated before the siege of Harpagus, and
founded Abdera on this coast&mdash;they now became
subjects of the Persians. In return for the great
service which he had rendered at the bridge on the
Danube, Histiaeus the prince of Miletus received
permission to found a colony on the Strymon, where
it leaves Lake Prasias, in the land of the Edonians,
near Myrcinus, on the north-west spur of Pangaeum,
which is here clothed with magnificent forests, and
possessed fruitful veins of silver.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Histiaeus began
at once to build the walls which were to protect the
new settlement.</p>

<p>With the subjugation of the Paeonians and the
crossing of the Strymon, Megabyzus reached the
border of an empire, the Macedonian kingdom, the
central district of which lay between the Axius and
the Haliaemon. Amyntas, the son of Alcetas,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> the king
of Macedonia, was requested by Megabyzus through
an embassy of seven Persians to send earth and water
as tokens of submission to Darius. Amyntas was in
great terror of the Persians, as Herodotus tells us;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
he did not refuse the request, and thus acknowledged
the sovereignty of the Persians. In order to do
honour to his envoys, they were hospitably entertained.
But when in their intoxication they laid
hands on the women of the royal house, Alexander
the young son of Amyntas caused them to be cut
down with their train. As they did not return,
Megabyzus sent his son Bubares, the brother of the
Zopyrus who had done good service before Babylon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
and was now viceroy there, with an armed force.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
Amyntas was prepared to pay a large sum as a fine,
and to receive the son of Megabyzus at his royal
house; he gave his own daughter Gygaea, the sister
of Alexander, in marriage to Bubares.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>While Megabyzus subjugated the Thracian coast
with its harbours and trading-places to the west as
far as the Strymon, Otanes had completed the reduction
of the rebellious Greek towns to the south of
the straits, on the shores of Asia Minor. Not only
Lamponium and Antandrus, opposite Lesbos, but also
Abydus, Chalcedon, and Byzantium were punished.
Coes, who had led the ships from Lesbos to the
Danube, had been rewarded for his services to Darius
by the government of the island. He was not required
to furnish ships to Otanes for the conquest of Lemnos
and Imbros. The Lemnians resisted bravely. When
they had been conquered, Otanes made Lycaretus, a
brother of Maeandrius of Samos (p. 261), tyrant of the
island, and he governed it till his death (towards 500
<small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>). With the conquest of Lemnos and Imbros, two
large and important islands in the &AElig;gean Sea, in
addition to Samos, Chios and Lesbos were gained for
the Persian kingdom.</p>

<p>After the expedition across the Danube, Darius
intended to carry his conquests to the west of Europe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
not to the north. The cantons of Hellas were the
aim towards the attainment of which Megabyzus and
Otanes prepared the way. The co-operation of the
marine appeared indispensable for further enterprises
in this direction. The events at the bridge over the
Danube had shown Darius that it was extremely rash
to leave in the hands of the tyrants of the Greeks the
command of the fleet formed out of the vessels from
their cities. The Phenicians he could certainly trust,
if he led them against the Greeks, but the navigation
of the Greeks had long ago driven the trade of the
Phenicians from the Greek coasts. In any case it was
advisable that a number of leading Persians should be
acquainted with the Greek waters, that they might
be entrusted with the command of squadrons. That
Persians were equal to such an office had been shown
in Africa. Darius commanded fifteen Persians selected
by himself to go on board Phenician ships in order to
visit and investigate the coasts of Hellas and Sicily.
The expedition embarked on two Sidonian ships of
the line, which were accompanied by a transport
vessel, and set sail from Sidon. On board was a
Greek physician as interpreter and guide&mdash;Democedes
of Croton, who had previously been physician to
Polycrates of Samos. He had accompanied his master
on his unfortunate voyage to Magnesia (p. 261). After
the execution of Polycrates, Oroetes had released the
Samians in his company, and retained the rest as
slaves in his house. When Bagaeus had caused
Oroetes to be slain he sent his property and slaves
to the court of the king, where Democedes was kept
in rags and chains along with his companions in
misfortune. It happened that Darius, in leaping from
his horse when hunting, dislocated his ancle. The
Egyptian physicians, who were in the greatest repute in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the east, and had already been retained since the
time of Cyrus at the Persian court (p. 134), could not
cure the mischief. At last some one remembered to
have heard of the fame of Democedes among the
Greeks. Darius caused him to be summoned, and was
healed by him. Soon after Democedes cured Atossa,
the daughter of Cyrus, the first wife of Darius, of a
dangerous tumour in the breast. In return for his
successful treatment Darius presented him with two
pairs of golden chains; and when receiving them
Democedes, according to the Greeks, inquired: Whether
the king desired to double his misery in return for the
cure? From that time he was in high favour with
the king, and was appointed a companion of his table,
one of the greatest and rarest distinctions in Persia;
it was said to be his intercession which rescued the
Egyptian physicians who were about to be crucified
because they were unable to heal Darius. He now
accompanied the expedition, as a man acquainted
with the localities, to Hellas and Sicily, in the year
512 <small>B.C.</small> The king bade the Persians keep watch
upon Democedes, and not suffer him to escape to the
Hellenes. The expedition sailed round Hellas; it
kept close to the shore, and sketched the coast; as
Herodotus remarks, these were the first Persians who
had come to Greece. From Hellas they directed
their course to lower Italy. When the Persians were
at Tarentum Democedes succeeded in escaping. When
it was discovered that he had gone to Crotona, his
native city, the Persians sailed thither and requested
the inhabitants to give him up, but in vain. Then
they experienced a further disaster; they were driven
to Iapygia; the crew were captured and enslaved;
only after some time had passed were the Persians
ransomed by Gillus, a Tarentine exile, and carried back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
to Persia.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> However vexatious the loss of his physician
might be to Darius, this expedition enabled him
to prepare for the enterprise in the Greek waters
which he had in view. The main object was attained;
a number of Persians had been made acquainted with
the sea and the coasts.</p>

against the Egyptians who rebelled against the tyranny of Aryandes,
had again gained their affection by offering a prize of 100 talents of
gold to the discoverer of a new Apis in the place of that which had
just died, cannot be referred to the Apis which died in the year 518
<small>B.C.</small> In that year Darius was fighting in Media against Phraortes,
Aryandes was satrap in the year 512 <small>B.C.</small> and long after. Hence it
must refer to the second Apis, which appeared in 491 <small>B.C.</small>, the thirty-first
year of Darius, for which Darius caused a sepulchre to be built.
That the first rebellion of the Egyptians against Darius took place
about this time follows from a chapter in Aristotle's "Rhetoric," 2, 20,
where we are told that Darius did not cross over to Hellas before he had
reduced Egypt; and in like manner Xerxes reduced Egypt before
crossing over to Hellas. The "crossing over" can only refer to the
campaign of Datis and Artaphernes; the first rebellion of Egypt
against Darius therefore took place just when the rebellion of the
Ionians had been crushed, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> 492, 491 <small>B.C.</small>; the second occurred in
486 <small>B.C.</small></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE STATE OF DARIUS.</h3>


<p>The perseverance and vigour of Darius had succeeded
in re-establishing and extending the kingdom
of Cyrus. In the west he had reached Mount
Olympus and the great Syrtis, in the east the course
of the Indus, high up among the Himalayas; in the
north the boundaries were the Caucasus and the
Jaxartes, in the south the tribes of Arabia and the
negroes above Nubia. He set himself to give a regulated
administration to this empire, which had been
acquired by such vast conquests, and which in its wide
extent threw the empire of the Assyrians completely
into the shade. He made the first attempt known
to history to organize his conquests and govern them
on a fixed plan. Thus he became the real founder
of the Persian empire. He succeeded so far that
an empire, the like of which had not been seen upon
earth, which enumerated the most various nations
among its subjects, was really governed, and the
foundations which he laid were so firm that in spite
of many serious rebellions, the empire never fell from
internal disorganization.</p>

<p>The chief support of the kingdom lay in the proud
feeling of the Persians that they were the ruling
nation of Asia, and governed the nations through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
their king and with their king. They saw with
satisfaction how the tribute, the contributions, the
prisoners of the subject nations came from the furthest
distance to their mountains, how the palaces of their
king rose in ever-increasing splendour on their native
soil, what brilliance and magnificence surrounded their
ruler, the king of kings. From the Persians were
chosen the magistrates who governed the provinces,
and the generals who commanded their contingents;
Persians surrounded the king and were his counsellors
and judges. The court, the administration, and the
army opened the most brilliant prospect to every
Persian who was in a position to distinguish himself
in the eyes of the king; and service in war offered
acceptable pay to the man of the people. Persian
troops, excellently appointed, protected the person of
the king; they formed the garrisons of the fortresses,
they were the nucleus of the army, and marched
before the rest of the troops. In solemn processions
and parades, the Persians were always on the right
of the king.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> They were not only free from tax and
tribute of every kind, but largesses of money were
made whenever the king entered Pasargadae (V. 357).
Plato's Laws maintain that Darius established as law
the allotments which Cyrus promised the Persians;
in this way he had shown his inclination to the
Persians and had established a common feeling between
the ruler and the nation.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> However this may
be, every one, even the meanest Persian, felt that
he had a share in the government of Asia.</p>

<p>It was a principle of the king of Persia from the
time of Cyrus to grant to the leading families of the
Persians and the Persian nobility a rich share in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
fruits and advantages of the empire, but at the same
time to accustom them to dependence and subjection,
and to train up in them a vigorous class of magistrates
and officers. If the wealthy families of Persia remained
in their old mode of life in the country, with
their flocks, such a position might keep up a feeling
of independence and freedom which was hardly compatible
with the unlimited power of the king and
the interests of the empire. It was desirable to bring
them to the court, and keep them under supervision,
to make them dependent on the favour of the
king, and habituate them to constant service. The
Median court had been numerous; the Persian court
was even more extensive, not merely for the sake of
magnificence, or to display the splendour and greatness
of the ruler, and so impose upon the Persians
and the subject nations, but also with a view of
educating the nobility in court life. No one could
count on advancement who did not show himself
at the gate of the king; indeed it was difficult for
any one whom the king did not see to obtain a
hearing from him. Those whose duty it was to
appear at court were urged not to fail in their
appearance.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> In this way they learnt not merely
behaviour and conduct, modesty and self-control,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> but
were accustomed to live in the shadow of the throne,
and to seek the sun of royal favour. In the immediate
neighbourhood of the king men could look up with
obedience and respect to the greatness of the ruler.
If in this way the nobility were linked round the
court, and instructed to strive for the favour of the
king as the highest honour, if the strict ceremonial
of the court reduced them to constant obedience, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
king on the other hand had opportunity to select, from
personal knowledge and confidence, the magistrates
to whom important posts might be entrusted.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>The officers round the person of the king, and
employed in the service of the state and court, were
numerous. Next to the throne came the six tribal
princes, who wore the upright kidaris, the sign of
royalty, and to them, as we often find, the most difficult
duties in war, and the most important expeditions and
provinces were entrusted. Next to the tribal princes
were the seven supreme judges of the kingdom, who
watched over the hereditary customs, and the controller
of the empire, "the king's eye." Less influential, but
nevertheless important owing to their personal relation
to the king, were the "quiver-bearer" and the
"lance-bearer"; we find the persons who filled these
offices at the time depicted on the relief at Behistun
beside the king. The office of "bearer of the king's
footstool" is also mentioned. The great court-offices,
of the "chief staff-bearer," "messenger," "announcer,"
"chief butler," "master of the horse," and "master
of the chase," together with various other honourable
offices, and many subordinate places, gave an opportunity
of uniting a large number of Persians closely
with the court life, and employing as viceroys and
generals those whom the king had found to be excellent
servants.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> But Medes were employed in the service
of the kingdom as well as Persians. If Media was
treated in other respects like the rest of the provinces
(it had to pay yearly 450 talents of tax, and furnish
100,000 sheep for the court), the system of Cyrus,
who by entrusting important commissions to eminent
Medes, had attempted to reconcile Media to the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
position of affairs, was followed by Darius in spite of
the rebellion. From other nations only those who
had been specially tested were in rare cases entrusted
with high offices.</p>

<p>Cyrus had introduced the custom of rewarding
loyalty and devotion to the king and service to the
kingdom by distinctions, marks of honour, and gifts
conferred in the most marked and distinctive manner,&mdash;of
exciting ambition and emulation by favour and
liberality. Who makes such presents, said Xenophon,
as the king of the Persians?&mdash;armlets, chains, and
horses with golden bridles; no one could possess such
things unless they were presented to him by the
king.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Who could compare with the decorated friends
of the king of Persia?&mdash;he alone appeared in more
splendid array. The sending of a portion from the
royal table was no slight honour.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The present of
the kaftan (kandys) was a common distinction; more
important were the golden armlets, the golden chain, the
golden crown, the golden wreath, the golden sabre, the
horse with golden harness. Other presents were also
made, as plane-trees and vines of gold, golden millstones
more than 300 pounds in weight.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> There were
also gifts of property, and allocations of the produce
of certain cities and districts. Pre-eminent services
were rewarded by the title "Benefactor"; we remember
that the Avesta requires the good thought, the
good word, and the good act. Besides these distinctions,
advancement to the upper classes of the
kingdom counted as the highest honour. The "table
companions" of the king, and above them "the kinsmen"
of the king had the first portion in the kingdom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
after the tribal princes and the great officers. The
bestowal of the rank of the table companion conferred
the right to eat at or near the table of the king,
and occasionally to make merry with him. The
elevation to be a "kinsman of the king" conferred
the rank of an Ach&aelig;menid, a prince of the house.
Like the king, the kinsmen wore a pale blue band
round the tiara, and had the right to kiss the king,
a custom which was usual in Persia among persons of
equal rank.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>According to the statements of Herodotus, the boys
of the Persians were instructed from their fifth to
their twentieth year (Xenophon and Strabo assert till
their twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth year) in riding,
shooting with the bow, and speaking the truth.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> In
the Laws we are told that the boys of the Medes were
entrusted to the women, and those of the Persians
to free men. According to the assertion of Nicolaus
of Damascus, Cyrus was already instructed in the
philosophy of the Magians, in justice and truthfulness,
as the hereditary laws prescribed for the leading
Persians.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Plato tells us that the sons of the kings
of the Persians were attended by eunuchs till their
seventh year; from that time till the fourteenth year
they learned to ride, shoot, and hunt. Then they
received distinguished teachers, of whom the first
instructed them in the wisdom of Zoroaster, and the
business of the crown, the second in the duty of
truthfulness, the third in temperance, the fourth in
courage and bravery.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>  Plutarch observes that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Magian presided over the education of the princes and
instructed them even in magic.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Xenophon narrates
that the princes and the children of the leading
Persians were brought up "at the gate" of the king,
where they learned temperance and prudence and
saw nothing unbecoming. They observed what men
were honoured by the king and whom he punished,
and thus learned even in their boyhood to command
and obey. Modesty and obedience were counted as
a distinction among these boys. In this way they
learned to be excellent riders, to throw the javelin,
and use the bow. At a later time they became so
skilful in hunting that they ventured to encounter a
bear.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Even now, he says in another passage, it is
the custom to educate children at the court, but the
exercise in riding has fallen into disuse, because they
no longer go where they could gain reputation by
skill in the art; and if in former days they seemed
to learn justice when they listened to just sentences,
they now see that he obtains justice who gives
most. And if they formerly learned the nature of
all plants in order to avoid what was noxious, they
now seem to have acquired this knowledge in order
to do as much mischief as possible.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> In Strabo's
account the education seems arranged even more
systematically. He tells us that the Persian boys
were brought up, fifty together, with one of the sons
of the king, or with the sons of the satraps. Intelligent
men were appointed to teach them, who instructed
them in the legends of the gods, sometimes
with and sometimes without song, and also recounted
to them the noblest deeds of men, besides those of
gods.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> At the same time the boys and young men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
were rendered hardy. They were aroused early in
the morning by the sound of a gong, and for food
commonly received barley or wheaten bread, and
water to drink; when hunting or keeping the flocks,
they were compelled to live on wild fruits, acorns,
and forest berries, and to pass the night in the open
air. They had also to learn to distinguish wholesome
and noxious herbs, to plant trees, and prepare
hunting nets.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Putting this evidence together, and remembering
that even in the fourth century the kings and their
retinue undertook long hunting expeditions on horseback,
without permitting themselves to be checked
by weariness, heat or cold, hunger or thirst,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> there
seems to be no doubt that the Persian kings introduced
a system of education for the officers on the
basis of the old mode of life and the customs of the
nation, and in this system their own sons, so far as
seemed good, had a part. Riding and shooting were
national exercises among the Persians; hunting was
necessary for the protection of the flocks, and was
therefore carried on as a religious duty no less than
as a pleasure; from all antiquity the keeping of flocks
and the protection of them against beasts of prey was
assigned to the youth. If these exercises were systematized,
and regard was paid to the prospect of military
service in some official capacity, if the young men
were also accustomed to unhesitating obedience, such
a school might be expected to supply capable and
active officers and good generals. A hardy and vigorous
life was the more necessary for the sons of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Persians as luxury began to spread among the higher
classes after the successes of Cyrus. We may believe
the accounts of the Greeks that instruction in religion
formed a part of the system; the Avesta requires such
instruction, and it is usual among the Parsees at the
present day (V. 196, 202). But the Greeks are wrong
in supposing that these cadet schools were the general
mode of education among the Persians, and maintaining
that the Persian boys received a training like
those of the Spartans. It was only for political
reasons that a number of young men from the
eminent families were educated to be generals and
viceroys. Xenophon has perceived that the education
was limited to the higher classes, and states this
distinctly in the "Anabasis." This education went on
partly under the eyes of the king at court, partly at
the courts of the satraps, which were arranged on the
pattern of the royal household.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Even under the
Sassanids the sons of the nobles were educated at
court; we have special mention of the teachers of
the horsemen.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>It was not the intention of Cyrus or Darius to
interfere with the life and habits of the subject
nations more than was necessary in order to maintain
their supremacy and to secure obedience. The
ancient dynasties in Babylon and Egypt were removed;
Cyrus, Cambyses, Darius, and Xerxes are
called kings of Babylon in numerous inscriptions;<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> in
Egypt, as the native inscriptions have shown us, they
received the style and title of the Pharaohs. In both
countries they take the place of the native monarchs,
and not in name only, for at the same time they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
undertake the protection of the national religion
and law. The peculiar ordinances and the law, the
political and administrative arrangements of the subject
lands, are said to have continued under the
Persian empire to the widest possible extent. In some
cases, indeed, old native families remained at
the head of affairs, as in Cilicia, the Phenician
and Cyprian cities; in Bactria native princes governed
the districts (V. 236); in the cities of the Greeks and
the subjugated islands of the &AElig;gean Sea, the Persian
kings had set up princes from the native population.
The nomad tribes of the empire could only be ruled
by keeping up relations with their chiefs. But in
whatever way the various parts of the subject territory
were arranged, whether there were princes or a
more popular administration, their communities, their
lands and cities, were left to govern themselves in
their hereditary manner, according to their own
customs, laws, and rules, provided that they paid
tribute and furnished a contingent in war. Darius
appears even to have taken upon himself the development
of the national law; we have seen that the
Egyptians called him their sixth law-giver (p. 300).</p>

<p>The gods, the modes of religion and worship, were
interfered with even less than the custom and law
of the subject nations, notwithstanding that Cyrus
and Darius with the Persians and Arians of Iran may
have been convinced that there could be none but
lying gods and false worship beside Auramazda and
Mithra, and the gods of the Arians. The kings of
the Persians were not even content with this liberal
tolerance which forms the chief glory of their rule;
they promoted the worship of the subject nations.
The inscription on the brick at Senkereh,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> mentions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Cyrus as the restorer of the great temple of Merodach
at Babylon (the tower of Belus), and of the temple
of Nebo at Borsippa (Bit-Zida); we found Cambyses
with the Egyptian title of the new sun-god, and
celebrated as the restorer of the worship of Neith at
Sais; he is also represented in adoration before the
Apis which died in his reign. And in this matter
Darius did not remain behind his predecessors. We
have already heard from the Egyptian Uzahorsun that
he was sent to Egypt soon after the accession of
Darius, in order to take care of the habitations of the
gods and their festivals, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to support and maintain
the religious worship. In his temple at the Oasis of
El Charigeh, Darius, adorned with the title "rival
of the sun," offers prayer to Ammon with the ram's
head. Darius caused the Apis which died in the
fourth year of his reign to be buried (p. 301), and
in spite of a recent rebellion, a sepulchre was built,
"to endure for ever," for the Apis which appeared in
the thirty-first year of his reign, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in 491 <small>B.C.</small>; to
make room for this the gallery of Psammetichus was
extended. Darius, it is said, proposed a prize of 100
talents of gold for the discovery of this new Apis.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Nor was it Egypt only which experienced the care
of Darius for the national worship of the subject
nations. The Samaritans had hindered the restoration
of the temple and walls of Jerusalem, which the
exiles from Babylonia had taken in hand, by threats
and by warnings to the court of Cyrus (p. 99).
When Darius ascended the throne, the prophets
Haggai and Zechariah called upon their countrymen to
finish the restoration of the temple. Haggai reproved
the indifference to solemn duties and the selfishness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
which allowed panelled houses to rise for men, while
the house of God was desolate: "therefore the heavens
restrained their dew, and the earth her increase." He
reminded them of the punishments which had come
upon their fathers for neglecting the will of Jehovah:
he demanded vigorous action from Zerubbabel and
the high priest Joshua; he pronounced the blessing of
Jehovah, if the temple were finished and proclaimed
to Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, to whom, eighteen
years before (p. 93), Cyrus had entrusted the leadership
of the "sons of captivity," that Jehovah would
keep him as his seal-ring if the work were finished.
To Joshua Zechariah promises royal splendour and
long posterity in return for the building of the temple.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
When the temple is restored, the scattered remnants
of Israel would return, and if the walls of Jerusalem
were not restored, Jehovah would be a wall of fire
to his city. "Many people and mighty nations will
come to seek Jehovah at Jerusalem, and make supplication
in the presence of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The exhortations
of the prophets had such effect that the building
of the temple and the city-walls was taken up again
in the second year of Darius (520 <small>B.C.</small>). When the
satrap of Syria, who is called Thathnai in the book of
Ezra, and his subordinates raised the question&mdash;who
had given permission for the building&mdash;the Jews fell
back on the written permission of Cyrus. The satrap
referred the matter to the king. According to the
narrative of the Jews Darius caused a search to be
made for this document in Babylon and Ecbatana,
and when it was found in the archives at Ecbatana,
he sanctioned the building by a new royal rescript.
The work was carried on under repeated exhortations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
of the two prophets, and after four years and five
months it was completed. In the sixth year of Darius
(516 <small>B.C.</small>), seventy years after Nebuchadnezzar had
pulled it down, the temple was rebuilt. The dedication
was made by a sin-offering of twelve goats from
the twelve tribes of Israel, and a thank-offering of
100 bulls, 200 rams, and 400 lambs.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> The walls of
the city and the ancient citadel of David by degrees
rose once more.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>In the place of the governorships which Cyrus and
Cambyses had established as the need arose, Darius
introduced fixed departments. About the year 515
<small>B.C.</small> the kingdom was divided into twenty satrapies.
Asia Minor was broken up into four satrapies. The
first included the west coast of Asia Minor; it was
the narrow strip of coast in which lay the Greek
cities from the Sigean promontory as far as Caria;
the territory of the Carians also, and that of the
Lycians, the Solymi, and Pamphylians, under the
Taurus on the south coast, were attached to this
satrapy. The second satrapy, of which the metropolis
was Sardis, comprised Mysia and Lydia, together
with the southern strip of Phrygia. To the third
satrapy, the satraps of which resided at Dascyleum
on the Hellespont, the Greek cities on the Hellespont,
the Propontis, and the Bosphorus were allotted; the
Thracians in Asia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Bithynians, the Paphlagonians,
the Phrygians as far as the Halys, and the
Cappadocians beyond the Halys as far as the border
of Armenia. Cilicia with its metropolis of Tarsus
was the fourth satrapy. Between Asia Minor and
the highlands of Iran there were six satrapies. The
Tibarenes, Mosynoeci, Macrones, and Moschians on the
Pontus, formed the first (the eighteenth in Herodotus'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
reckoning); the nations who dwelt to the east of
them in the valley of the Araxes, the Saspeires and
Alarodians, along with the western part of Armenia,
formed the second (the eleventh); the rest of Armenia
the third (the thirteenth); Syria and Phoenicia and
the island of Cyprus the fourth (the fifth);<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Assyria
and Babylonia, with the metropolis, Babylon, the fifth
(the ninth); the land of the Cissians (Susiana) on the
left bank of the Tigris the sixth (the eighth). Egypt
with Cyrene and Barca, the subject tribes in Ethiopia
and Libya, formed a separate satrapy (the sixth); the
satrap resided at Memphis. The table-land of Iran
was broken up into nine satrapies. These were the
satrapy of Media (the tenth); the satrapy of the
Caspians, which comprised the lands to the north of
the Medes on the Caspian Sea, the valley of the
Cyrus, and the lands of the Cardusians, the Mardians,
the Tapurians and Hyrcanians (the nineteenth); the
satrapy of the Parthians, Arians, Chorasmians, and
Sogdians (the sixteenth); the satrapy of the Sacae
(the fifteenth); the satrapy of the Bactrians, to which
the Margians also seem to have belonged (the twelfth);<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
the satrapy of the Sattagyd&aelig; (Thataghus) and the
Gandarians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the Gedrosians, the Arachoti, and
the Gandharas, on the south bank of the Cabul (the
seventh);<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> the satrapy of the Sagartians and Sarangians,
which extended in the east of Persia as far to the
south as the Persian Gulf, and included the islands
belonging to it (the fourteenth); the satrapy of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Paricanians and Ethiopians in Asia; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the inhabitants
of the southern edge of the table-land on the
east, including the black tribes in the delta of the
Indus (the seventeenth); and finally the satrapy of
the Indians, which included all the tribes on the right
bank of the Indus, from the summits of the Himalayas
to the junction of the Cabul and the Indus (the
twentieth).<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The viceroys whom Darius placed over these districts
had to keep the aggregate of the various political
bodies, of which the satrapies consisted, in obedience
to the empire and in peace towards each other; to
collect the taxes and tribute, to summon and organize
the military levies. The satrap was the highest authority
in his province&mdash;the supreme appeal in law,
administration, and military affairs. The king alone
was superior. He was the judge before whom could
be laid appeals from the judgment of the princes
and local boards, if the claimant had not preferred
to go to him in the first instance; he was the only
judge between the princes, the districts, the tribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
and cities of his province. His arrangements must
be obeyed. He was to take measures for the advancement
of cultivation and the increase of the population
in his province, both as fullfilling the rules
of the Avesta, and in the interest of the kingdom.
He kept watch over trade and currency, over the
military roads, the stations, the harbours, the canals
and dams; he had the right to strike silver coins for
his province. He had charge of the military affairs
of the province; and was responsible for the weapons
and ships when required for the levy. The apportionment
of the taxes and tributes to the districts
and communities of the province, the collection of
these, and the despatch of the proper revenues to the
king were among his duties. He had royal scribes
to assist him in these matters, who read to him the
commands of the king and drew up his reports to
the king. It was not likely to escape Darius that
the great powers in the hands of the satrap would
lead him to use his delegated power independently
and even against his chief. The attempt of Oroetes
to found an independent monarchy in Asia Minor,
had caused him great anxiety in a time of difficulty.
He could not always expect that such tendencies in
distant provinces could be known in time, or that
rebellions on the part of satraps could be prevented.
The king withdrew from them the nomination
of the commanders of the castles, which controlled
the main roads of the provinces, the more
important fortresses and citadels of the provinces,
<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> the citadels at Ecbatana, Babylon, and Memphis,
that, as Xenophon says, "a satrap who trusting to his
power and the number of his subjects should refuse
obedience, might find opponents in his province";
and he even nominated the commanders of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Persian battalions, which formed the garrisons of the
fortresses,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> but limitations of this kind were insufficient
against the power which their office gave to
the satrap, if the royal power was unable to make
itself felt with force and rapidity. The central power
must be in vigorous operation against the satraps,
if the feeling of dependence and responsibility were
to be kept alive among them. Appeals from the
jurisdiction of the satraps to the king were possible
for the adjacent provinces and did occur, but for
the inhabitants of more distant provinces they were
extremely difficult; yet these were the provinces
chiefly in point. If months elapsed before an order
of the kings reached Memphis or Sardis, the Indus
or the Caucasus, or the satraps of these provinces received
an answer to their questions, the necessary result
would be that these men would regard themselves as
independent, withdrawn from all authority and obedience.
And the distant provinces, no less than the
satraps, had to be kept in order. If reinforcements
were to be sent to them the march must not be too
long; if the borders were to be defended at the
right time, the advance of the army from the inner
provinces must not occupy too much time. The
larger the empire the more urgently were rapid communications
required to give reality to the operation
of the central force and secure the kingdom within
and without. The distance from the Strymon to the
Indus was enormous; from Ephesus to the Hindu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Kush was 3000 miles, and from Memphis to Sogdiana
2500 miles.</p>

<p>Darius perceived that the kingdom could not be
governed or maintained without good communications.
When the western border of the empire touched the
Hellespont, the palaces in Persia were too far to the
east; and the difficulty was increased when Africa,
as far as the greater Syrtis, and the Thracian coast
and Macedonia in Europe had been conquered.
Reasons of this kind must have induced Darius to
place the centre of administration as nearly as possible
in the centre of the kingdom; yet he dared not
venture to move too far from Persia. He did not
hesitate to move his residence further to the west
out of the native territory into Susiana, a region
occupied by subjects of alien race and language, and
make Susa the centre and metropolis of the kingdom.
Strabo tells us that Cyrus and the Persians saw that,
after the subjugation of the Medes, their land lay
at the remote edge, while Susiana was more in the
centre, and nearer the Babylonians and the other
nations. For this reason they transferred the seat
of the monarchy there, availing themselves of the
proximity of the land and the fame of the city.
The change was the more desirable because Susiana
had never pursued an ambitious course of policy, but
had always been part of a larger state, except perhaps
in the times of the heroes.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> It is a mistake in
Strabo, which however Herodotus and Aeschylus had
already made, to say that Cyrus transferred the
residence from Persia to Susa. Aeschylus speaks of
Darius as the Susa-born god of Persia; and Herodotus
places the palace and government of the Pseudo-Smerdis
at Susa; it is from the tower of the walls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of the citadel of Susa that Prexaspes throws himself;
there the Magian is assassinated, Darius is raised to
the throne, and resides from the very beginning of
his reign. But this is an anticipation of the residence
which was erected here by Darius with the intention
that it should be the fixed abode of himself and his
successors, the centre of the kingdom and the government.
Pliny and Aelian tell us definitely that
Darius built Susa the royal citadel of the Persians,
and the inscriptions confirm this statement.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Not
less incorrect is the remark of Strabo, that Susiana
had always formed part of a larger kingdom, and had
never pursued an ambitious policy. On the contrary
we saw how Elam, after an independence of 1500
years, became subject first to Assyria for a few decades,
and then to Media and Persia. And the Elamites
had so little forgotten their ancient days that they
rose three times against Darius.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>The intention to keep the Semitic lands in check, to
be nearer Babylon, without giving up the communication
with the native land, must have contributed
to the resolution of Darius to transfer the residence
to Susa. If Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried
a road from his metropolis in a slanting direction
through the desert to Syria (III. 365), works of this
kind were far more urgently needed for the immensely
greater extent of the Persian empire. Great roads
must be made from Susa in all directions to the
borders of the empire, and maintained. Though Cyrus
and Cambyses may have made some steps in this
direction, it was Darius who carried out the plan and
founded the great system of roads which traversed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Persia in all directions, and were now carried from
Susa. "Who," asks Xenophon, "could so quickly
strike down opponents, separated from him by a road
of many months, as the king of the Persians?"<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> At
the close of his "Persian History" Ctesias gave a
sketch of the Persian roads, which led from Ephesus
to Bactria and India, with an account of the stations,
days'-journey, and parasangs. This is lost. We know
but one member of the system, the road which led
from Susa, past Sardis, to Ephesus. Of this road,
which interested the Greeks most, Herodotus gives
the following account: "From the Greek sea to Susa
is a distance of 14,040 stades (1755 miles). From
Ephesus to Sardis is a distance of 540 stades (67&frac12;
miles), which can be traversed in three days. From
this point there are royal stations and the most excellent
inns: the whole road passes through inhabited
lands and is secure. First, it passes through the region
of the Lydians, who inhabit a fruitful land and are rich
in silver; then through the region of the Phrygians,
who are rich in cattle and fruits of the field; these
make up 20 stations, 94&frac12; parasangs. Then the Halys
has to be crossed; there are gates here through which
you must pass in order to go over the river, and
a strong guard-house. Beyond the river you are in
Cappadocia, and to the borders of Cilicia is a distance
of 28 stations and 104 parasangs. On the borders
of Cappadocia and Cilicia are two gates and two
guard-houses: passing through Cilicia in three stations,
a distance of 15 parasangs, you reach the border of
Armenia which is formed by the Euphrates. The
Euphrates is crossed by a ferry. In Armenia, which
possesses much cattle, there are 15 stations provided
with guard-houses, and 56&frac12; parasangs. Then follows the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Tigris, and two other rivers bearing the same name (the
Greater and the Lesser Zab); and finally the Gyndes,
which Cyrus diverted from its channel: these have to
be crossed in boats. From Armenia you pass to the
Matieni, the neighbours of the Armenians; here there
are 34 stations and 137 parasangs to be traversed;
from the borders of the Matieni and the Cissians (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the Susiani) to the Choaspes, where Susa is built upon
it (this river has also to be crossed by a ferry), are
11 stations and 42&frac12; parasangs, making a total of 111
stations and 450 parasangs, or 13,500 stades (1687&frac12;
miles). Hence if the royal road has been rightly
measured, and a traveller makes 150 stades (five
parasangs, 19 miles) a day, he goes from Sardis to
Susa in 90 days, and to Ephesus (if we add in the
distance from Ephesus to Sardis) in 93 days."</p>

<p>From this description we see that the road has been
accurately measured, well-kept, guarded, and provided
with stations about every 15 miles, in which the
travellers could find shelter. As Herodotus calls
these inns very beautiful, we must assume that after
the Persian fashion they were provided with plantations,
and this is confirmed by other evidence. We
are told that a station on the royal road in Cadusia,
in a wholly bare and treeless region, was surrounded
by a park of high pines and cypresses. The Indians
also were accustomed to plant their roads and provide
them with shady resting-places. The road from Sardis
to Susa did not take the shortest route; the object
was to escape the Syrian and Phrygian desert, and
carry the road through regions which could support
the army on the march. Hence it ran from Susa in
the valley of the Tigris on the left bank of the river
through Susiana and the native land of the Assyrians,
for 600 miles in a north-westerly direction, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
mountains of Armenia. The region between the
Tigris and the Zagrus to the north of the satrapy
of Cissia (Susiana) is called by Herodotus the land
of the Matieni, and he extends this name, which is
elsewhere used only for the tribes dwelling round the
Lake of Urumiah, to the Tigris. Armenia proper was
then crossed by the road in a straight line from east
to west, from the upper Tigris to the upper Euphrates.
Of Cilicia it touched merely the north-east corner,
and then cut through Cappadocia in a north-westerly
direction to the Halys. It crossed the river in the
neighbourhood of Pteria, passed in a south-westerly
direction through Phrygia, leaving the desert to the
south, and Lydia to Sardis.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> From this great road
to the west then branched off between the Gyndes
(Diala) and the Physcus (Adhem) the road to Babylon,
and at Physcus the road to Ecbatana.</p>

<p>The royal roads through the kingdom secured
before all things the rapid operation of the central
power and the king on the representatives of his power
in the provinces. The stations were used for a postal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
arrangement, the duty of which it was to carry the
commands of the king and the reports and questions
of the satraps. Thanks to this post the king was
in the possession of a means of communication far
superior to that within the reach of any of his subjects.
At the stations on all the roads of the kingdom,
at intervals of 15 miles or a little more, horses and
riders (Astandae, Angari) were placed, whose sole business
it was to carry the royal messages and errands.
One of these postmen must always be in attendance,
in order to carry a letter as soon as it arrived, at the
full speed of his horse, by day or by night, in heat
or in snow, to the next station. Among the Greeks
it was said that the Persian couriers travelled swifter
than cranes; Herodotus also assures us that nothing in
the world was more rapid than these horsemen.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Thus
the king's commands travelled on well-built and carefully-guarded
roads by this post in the shortest space
of time to the most remote provinces. They were
brought from Susa to Sardis in five or six days and
nights. The commands of the king to the satraps
were always given in writing, and accredited by the
impression of the king's seal.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> This seal presents to
us king Darius with the covered tiara on his head
standing on the chariot behind the charioteer; a lion,
struck by his arrow, lies beneath the hoofs of the horses
which are leaping forward. The king is about to shoot
a third arrow at a second huge lion, which has reared
himself up in self-defence, and has already received
two arrows from the king. At the side a date palm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
is visible; over the king hovers Auramazda. The
inscription, which is in three languages, says: "I am
Darius, the great king."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The rapidity with which
the king's commands reached even the satraps of the
most distant lands, kept the authority of the king
before them. The fortresses and guard-posts on the
roads not only served to maintain security on and
near them, and to make commerce safe; they were
also used to control trade, and travelling, and any
correspondence among the subjects. The fortresses
were placed at points which could not be avoided,
in narrow passes, or on the bridges of great rivers.
Those in command dared not allow any one to pass
who did not establish his right, as above suspicion.
The scribes assigned to the commanders looked over
all the letters, which were carried through by messengers.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
As the fortresses in which these guard-posts
lay were placed in the most important divisions of the
country, the roads could be closed by the posts. If
a rebellion arose in this or that quarter, the effect on
the neighbouring province was checked by closing the
roads by means of the forts, or the road was defended
from post to post. And if an enemy invaded from
outside he found in them points of resistance, and
the Persians points of support.</p>

<p>The guidance and control of the viceroys was not
confined to the rapid and lively communications between
them and the king. The Greeks tell us that
the king travelled every year to this or that province
in order to review the troops, and examine the cultivation
of the soil. Where the king did not make
a visitation in person, he did so by confidential ministers.
We are further informed that these visitations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
were entrusted to the princes of the royal house.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
Where the king found that the land was populous
and well cultivated, the forests in good order, and
the fields full of the fruits which the land produced,
he distinguished the governor by gifts and honours.
But where he found the land thinly populated and
badly cultivated, whether it was owing to the severity,
the neglect, or the extortion of the satrap, the
satrap was punished and removed from his place.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
The charge of the whole country lay on the chief
overseer, the high official who bore the title of the
"king's eye." In the Persians of Aeschylus, the
chorus inquire of Xerxes, "Where his faithful eye
has remained?" Herodotus notices as an arrangement
of the Median kingdom, that the king named
a man especially devoted to him, his "Eye." We
see that unexpected inspections were made by the
"Eye" of the Persian king, and that his subordinates,
who were not known to be such, carried on
a minute superintendence over the conduct of the
satraps, the other officers, and the subject people.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
Still more mysterious was the work of the officers
who were known as the king's "Ears." They cannot
have been far removed from spies. We saw to what
an extent the princes of India carried on the system
of secret espionage. Herodotus told us in regard to
Deioces that his spies and informers were in every
land, and a Persian proverb said, "The king has
many eyes and ears." The Greeks declare that the
Persian spies did not always content themselves
with relating what they had heard, but told much
besides in order to show their zeal. Accusation was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
received with favour by the king and rewarded by
distinctions and presents.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> We saw what control was
exercised on the great roads, the arteries of communication.
Owing to the number of guard-houses in
each road, which repeated the inquiries of the first,
any one at the court was in a position to compare
the accounts of the commanders, and to control them.
No one passed even the borders of Babylonia without
proving who he was, and of what city, and why he
was travelling.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> In this way every suspicious circumstance
was brought to light, and it was certain that no
conspiracy or rebellion could be contrived without some
indications being received at the court of the king.</p>

<p>What could not be prevented by the control of the
higher and lower officers, and the police supervision
of the subjects, was suppressed by the severe exercise
of punishment, which was intended to strike fear
into magistrate and subject alike by the force of
terrible examples. The terrorist use of punishment
which the Brahmans on the Ganges knew how to
prove to be a divine right, and a duty of the royal
office, was in Persia regarded as an indispensable
means for supporting the state. And as a fact obedience
to the absolute ruler rested, in the magistrates
and the ruling tribe, more decidedly on the apprehension
of punishment than on any personal interest
or common share in the maintenance of the kingdom;
and in the subject nations it rested on the fear of the
ruler and the interests which the Persian kings gained
in those districts. Those entrusted with the power
of office must also be the most obedient and submiss.
Above all, the feeling must be kept alive in the
satraps of the provinces that the enormous powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
delegated to them were given on the condition of
absolute obedience. The severe penalties which overtook
any resistance, or the careless execution of a royal
command, were only the reverse of the favours which
fell to their lot in other circumstances. However
earnestly the religion of Zarathrustra preached the
regard for life, the rules of religion were compelled,
even in Persia, to give way to reasons of state.
We find Darius no less than Cambyses inflicting
severe penalties for trifling offences. If the satraps
gave any grounds for suspicion, they were either
secretly or openly removed out of the way.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> But
even in the judges and on those who were not officers
every transgression and act of disobedience to the
wish of the king was cruelly punished. Darius,
who was not considered a harsh ruler, did not content
himself with the execution of Intaphernes; he caused
nearly all the males of the house to be put to death,
though Intaphernes had taken such a prominent part
in the assassination of the Magian. The leaders of the
rebellions in the provinces were punished by crucifixion
or hanging. Khsathrita, who caused the Medes to
revolt, and Chitratakhma, the leader of the Sagartians,
had their noses and ears cut off before execution, and
in this state were exposed to public view.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> When
Darius marched against the Scythians, Oeobazus, a
distinguished Persian, entreated that one of his three
sons might remain behind. The king considered that
this wish was not in harmony with the devotion
which every Persian owed to the kingdom; he replied
that all his sons should remain, and at once ordered
them to be executed. Sandoces, one of the royal
judges, had been bribed to give a false judgment;
Darius caused him to be crucified; he was already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
placed on the cross when the king remembered that
he had done more good than evil to the royal house,
and ordered him to be taken down again. He lived,
and remained in the service, but not in the highest
court of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> One of the mildest forms of
punishment was banishment to the islands of the
Persian Gulf. Common punishments were the loss
of eyes, nose, ears, tongue; the cutting off of hands,
arms, and feet; scourgings were frequent, and they
were inflicted even by the satraps.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> The king pronounced
the sentence of death by touching the girdle
of the accused, or occasionally allowed it to be pronounced
in his presence by the seven judges. The
sentence was then carried out by crucifixion or
decapitation.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> In later times we hear of grinding
between stones, incisions in the body while alive, and
painful imprisonment in troughs; Xenophon indeed
tells us that one of those who took part in the rebellion
of the younger Cyrus was tortured for a whole year.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>If we compare the practice of the princes of Persia
with the conduct of the Assyrian kings, and the
later rulers of the East, we cannot fail to recognize
that the officers under the Achaemenids were in a
better position and more richly paid, but also better
controlled and kept in greater dependence than was
the case afterwards. The subjects, in spite of acts
of cruel caprice which affected certain persons, were
incomparably better off than those of the Assyrians,
or of the dynasties which afterwards ruled the East.
They were governed with more intelligence and
clemency than the subjects of the Porte, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Khedive, or the Shah of Persia, or the Emirs of
Cabul and Herat. It was no small thing that the
Persian kings established peace in all Asia from the
shores of the Hellespont to the Belurdagh, and maintained
order and security from the Nile to the Himalayas.
Moreover, the religion and worship of the
subject nations, of whatever kind they might be, were
not injured, but rather protected and held in honour.
Law, justice, and manners remained the same, and the
subjects preserved their local self-government. Agriculture
in the provinces received attention, trade and
commerce went on along the roads and rivers of the
vast empire, and was not only unmolested but
protected.</p>

after the accession. This is impossible, owing to the rebellions,
which continued down to the year 517 <small>B.C.</small> But from the fact that
Herodotus includes the Indians in this arrangement, and represents the
Thracians and the islands as added subsequently (3, 94, 96), we may
conclude that it was made after the Indian conquests and before the
successes of Megabyzus and Otanes, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> about 515 <small>B.C.</small> The arrangement
of Darius was not retained without changes. Babylonia and
Assyria were afterwards separated; Babylonia formed one satrapy,
Syria and Assyria a second, Phoenicia and Arabia a third. The
satrapy of the Ionians revolted after the battle of Mycale; in the
Peloponnesian war, we find, as in the time of Cyrus, two satrapies in
hither Asia, Sardis and Dascyleum. Xenophon ("Anab." <i>in fine</i>)
enumerates six satrapies in Asia Minor: Lydia, Phrygia, Bithynia,
Paphlagonia, Cappadocia and Lycaonia, Cilicia. Arrian, ("Anab."
1, 12) enumerates five: Phrygia on the Pontus, Greater Phrygia,
Lydia, Cappadocia, Cilicia; and, finally, in these later periods several
satrapies were united in one hand.</p></div>

52) is to be filled up ("Monatsberichte der Berliner Akademie," 1857,
s. 123). Xenophon gives twelve short marches and about ten parasangs
from the foot of the Carduchian mountains to the Greater Zab&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
about 60 parasangs; from the Zab to the Physcus is 50 parasangs;
from the Physcus to the bridge of the Tigris at Sittace is 20
parasangs. The territory which he traversed in this region he considers
to be part of Media ("Anabasis," 2, 4 ff.). Hence there can be no
doubt that the length of the royal road from the point where it crossed
the Tigris to the borders of Susiana was 137 parasangs. If Xenophon
passed beyond the point at which the royal road crosses the Tigris, to
the north, this is amply compensated by the greater distance from the
bridge at Sittace to the Gyndes and the borders of Susiana. At Opis
the column of the Greeks came upon the Persians who were marching
from Ecbatana to Babylon. So the road from Ecbatana must have
joined the great royal road at Physcus, and then it ran past Sittace to
Babylon. Alexander also, in order to come from Babylon to Susa,
first marched north-east to Sittace, and after crossing the Tigris
proceeded south-east to Susa: Diod. 17, 65, 66.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FINANCE AND ARMY OF DARIUS.</h3>


<p>The empire of Darius rested on the fact that the
Persians regarded themselves as the governing nation
in Asia, and on their desire and determination to
maintain this position, with the advantages which it
brought to them; on the devotion and fidelity with
which the Persian tribal princes and nobles stood by
the king; on their habits of obedience and subjection;
on the ambition of officers and governors, which was
excited by obvious distinctions; on the education of
a considerable portion of the Persian youth specially
for service in the army and the state. Darius was
at pains to add to these foundations substantial
means for maintaining the empire in the greatest profusion.
When he abandoned the system of Cyrus and
Cambyses, who had allowed the provinces to fix the
amount of their yearly tribute themselves, and set
himself to secure a fixed income for the state, it was
previously necessary to fix the standard according to
which the tribute, which would now be paid as taxes,
should be assessed; to arrange the value at which the
royal chest would accept the various standards current
in the subject nations.</p>

<p>With this object he created a currency. He founded
his standard on the forms which the Babylonian
system had developed in the course of time. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
new gold currency was struck on the standard of the
Babylonian gold talent, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> on a normal weight of
50&frac12; pounds. Three thousand coins were struck out
of this total. The gold in this new currency was
purer than that used by Cr&#339;sus, or in the older coins
in the Ionic cities of Asia Minor; the coins which
have come down to us show but little alloy of silver.
The gold piece weighed 8.40 grammes; and had in
our coinage a value of about 21 shillings; hence
the gold talent of Darius was worth 3000 guineas.
These new pieces were called by the Hebrews Darkon
and Darkemon, among the Greeks Darics. It was
of the first importance to bring the gold of the coinage
into a simple and easily convertible ratio with silver.
In order to do this the silver coins were struck from
a larger weight than the gold. Here also Darius
used a Babylonian talent;&mdash;the silver talent of 67&frac12;
pounds, for the normal weight. From this 3000
staters were struck of a weight of 11.14 grammes;
or 6000 drachmas of a weight of 5.57 grammes. The
silver staters of Darius (silver darics) were called by
the Greeks Median sigli (shekels). As gold was
valued at 13&#8531; times the value of silver, the silver
stater, which was one-fourth heavier than the gold
coin, was equal to a tenth part of its value, and the
drachma to a twentieth. Hence the gold daric was
changed for ten silver staters or twenty silver
drachmas. The silver talent of Darius was worth
more than &pound;300 of our money, the silver stater
was worth about two shillings. The silver talent
of Darius (which the Greeks call the Babylonian
talent) stood to the Euboean talent of the Greeks,
who had used the light Babylonian talent as a standard,
in a ratio of 3 to 4.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>The new darics were marked with the figure of the
king. Three hundred have been lately found in the
bed of the canal which the son of Darius caused to
be cut through the promontory of Athos; and they
exhibit Darius running or kneeling, in a long cloak,
with the kaftan over it, the royal tiara on the head,
with thick hair and beard; in the right hand, which
is depressed, we find a lance; sometimes a sword;
and in the left, which is outstretched, the bow. The
silver coins of the king also carried his image; in
these he sometimes holds an arrow instead of a bow
in his left hand. For the Syrian districts Darius had
a special large silver coin of about 28 grammes struck,
in addition to the royal currency. These present
the king with his right hand elevated and his left
depressed, on his chariot, which is drawn by four or
six horses, which spring over a dead lion. On the
reverse is the picture of a city with towers. On
other coins of the same kind, the reverse of which
presents a galley with rowers, the king is also on his
chariot, the horses are moving slowly, and the royal
staff-bearer follows the chariot.</p>

<p>The new coinage was not entirely to expel or
replace the standards current in the provinces. The
coining of gold was indeed reserved for the crown,
but the old silver coins of the provinces were not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
allowed to be current, they might even be increased,
for the right to coin silver was left to the districts,
cities, and dynasties. They were allowed to use their
own standards, and mark their coins in whatever way
they pleased. Communities could put the arms of
the city, the dynasts their own portraits, on the coins.
The satraps also had the right to coin silver coins,
and mark them with special emblems, their names or
portraits (among the emblems we find two men before
a fire-altar, the form of Auramazda, etc.). The silver
money which the satraps struck had no legal privileges
over the common coins of the provinces. In the first
instance they were coined in exceptional cases when
there was a deficiency of the currency, or money was
needed for important military undertakings. The
satraps, like the countries, the cities, and dynasts,
rarely coined after the royal standard; they generally
followed the standards common in their provinces in
order to meet the local needs.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In the fourth century
B.C. they began to coin more frequently. At the
chest of the king only the royal currency was accepted;
all other coins were received as bullion,
weighed by the royal standard, and then melted
down in order to be struck in the royal currency
and issued when required.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>It was the opinion of Darius that the crown ought
to possess the means for the largest outlay that could
be demanded. The treasury of Cyrus was not perhaps
exhausted, but no doubt it was seriously diminished
by the campaigns of Cambyses, the Magian, the rising
of Vahyazdata, and the suppression of the rebellions.
The object to be attained was that the yearly income
should considerably surpass the yearly expenditure;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the excess could then be collected in the treasury,
which would thus be in a position to pay and support
for years the largest armies that could be required.
The care which Darius bestowed on the currency and
taxation astonished the Persians, who no doubt remembered
the magnanimous conduct of Cyrus, to
whom such things were of little moment; as Herodotus
tells us, they called him the "retail-dealer" in
contrast to Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The measure, by which Darius
imposed on all his lands the taxes which they had
to pay year by year, was the produce of their soil.
If the tax which was thus laid on the soil of the
provinces on a fixed ratio was not excessive, they
were nevertheless subject to services, and the crown
could with certainty reckon on the payment of the
contributions. The whole amount of arable land in
the provinces was measured by parasangs (each of
30 stades); and according to the extent, when thus
ascertained, and the quality of the soil, as Herodotus
states, the taxes of the provinces were fixed in the
royal currency. Within each province the various
countries and cantons, which formed a political unit,
whether under dynasts or chieftains, or some other
form of constitution, were burdened with a fixed share
of the contribution of the whole&mdash;as we may see from
the statement that the overseers of the cantons and
countries were responsible for the payment of the
taxes. After exhausting wars, new measurements
were made with a view to further valuations.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The
lowest contribution of land-tax was made by the
satrapy of the Arachoti (the Pactyans of Herodotus),
and the Gedrosians (the Sattagydae of Herodotus), to
which belonged also the Gandarians to the south of
Cabul; it amounted to 170 talents of silver (about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
&pound;50,000); the next lowest amount was 200 talents,
(about &pound;57,000), which was paid by two satrapies,
the Saspeires and Alarodians in the valley of the
Araxes, and the Caspians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Cadusians, the Mardians,
the Tapurians, and Hyrcanians. The satrapy
of the Sacians paid 250 talents (&pound;70,000). Four
satrapies paid 300 talents (&pound;85,000), the satrapy of
the Parthians, Areians, Chorasmians and Sogdiani, of
the Moschians and Tibarenes, of the Ionians and of
the Susiani. The satrapy of Syria with Ph&#339;nicia and
Cyprus paid 350 talents (&pound;100,000); the satrapies of
Bactria and Phrygia with Cappadocia paid 360 talents
each (&pound;103,000); Armenia, and the satrapy of the
Paricanians and Ethiopians in Asia, paid 400 talents
each (&pound;115,000); Media had to pay 450 talents
(&pound;130,000); the satrapies of Lydia and Cilicia 500
each (&pound;145,000); Drangiana (the Sarangians and
Sagartians) paid 600 talents (&pound;170,000); Egypt with
Cyrene, Barca, and the tribes of the Libyans, 700
talents (&pound;200,000); the satrapy of Babylon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
region to the south of the Armenian mountains between
the Euphrates and the Tigris as far as the
mouth of the rivers, paid 1000 talents (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> &pound;290,000).
This was the highest tax imposed on any satrapy;
from this assessment, as well as from other evidence,
we may conclude that Babylonia was the best cultivated
and most fruitful province in the whole kingdom.
The entire income from this satrapy is put by Herodotus
at an artab&egrave; of silver daily, and the Persian
artab&egrave; was larger by three choenixes than the Attic
medimnus. The artab&egrave;, therefore, was about equal
to a Prussian bushel, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to a measure of 2770 cubic
inches.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Darius thus received every year from the land-tax<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
of the provinces, 7600 talents of silver in the royal
standard, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in round figures &pound;2,500,000. To this
has to be added the large amount of gold-dust, which
the twentieth, or Indian satrapy, paid yearly to the
king. This amount, 360 talents according to Herodotus,
was not the land-tax of the province; it was
obtained from the gold-sands of the Himalayas.
This raised the net income of the treasury to a total
of about &pound;3,000,000, and to this again have to be
added the taxes imposed on Lemnos and Imbros, on
the Thracians and the Greek towns on the Thracian
coast, with the Macedonians, after the campaign to
the Danube, and the tribute in kind paid by the
subject tribes among the Arabians (1000 talents of
frankincense every year), and the negroes (ivory and
ebony), and the tribute in slaves paid by the Colchians
(100 boys and 100 virgins every fifth year).</p>

<p>More important than these contributions of the
Arabians, negroes, and Colchians, was the income in
money which the crown derived from local sources,
within the empire, and the proceeds of royal privileges&mdash;more
important still the produce in kind which
the provinces had to pay every year in addition to
the land-tax. In the satrapy of the Parthians and
Areians a large sum was paid every year for the
opening of the sluices of the Ares (no doubt an affluent
of the Margus, V. 9), without which the fields
were in that district dried up in the summer. In
Egypt the fishery on the canal, which connected
the lake of Amenemhat with the Nile, brought the
king every year 240 talents.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> In what way the contributions
in kind were divided and imposed upon
the provinces, it is not easy to see. Herodotus only
tells us that the whole kingdom was divided into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
cantons for the support of the king and army; a
full third of this burden fell upon the satrapy of
Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> We know that Cappadocia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Phrygia
and Cappadocia, the third satrapy of Herodotus,
provided each year, in addition to the land-tax of
&pound;103,000, 1500 horses, 2000 mules, and 50,000
sheep; Media in addition to her land-tax provided
double this amount of animals.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Armenia provided
10,000 foals each year in addition to the tax of
&pound;115,000.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Cilicia furnished 360 grey horses each
year. Besides these contributions in animals, there
were payments in corn for the garrisons in the provinces.
The Persians who formed the garrison of
the White Fortress in Memphis received yearly from
Egypt 120,000 bushels of wheat, an amount which
would abundantly supply the wants of 8000 men.
As wheat was cheap in Egypt this contribution would
represent a value of about &pound;8500.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Each province
sent its best products to the court; and nothing but
the best was brought to court or received there; there
all that was splendid in the empire was to be collected.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
Babylon sent every year 500 eunuch-boys
for service at the court, and Colchis sent male
and female slaves of Caucasian race. Chalybon
(Helbon) in Syria furnished wine for the court; wheat
came from the cities of the Aeolians and the Anatolian
coast, salt from the Libyans and the oasis of Siwah.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>"From ancient times," Theopompus of Chios informs
us, "the taxes and the entertainment of the
king were imposed on the cities according to their
size."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Ctesias and Deinon maintain that the table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of the king of Persia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the entertainment of the
entire court, cost 400 talents daily. This is grossly
exaggerated. From Herodotus we see that the support
of Xerxes and his train, the officers, and all the
necessary accompaniments, the tents and plate, and
moreover the feeding of the entire army for one day
cost the city of Abdera 300 talents, and the island
of Thasos 400 talents (&pound;85,000). Theopompus also
tells us that when the king visited a city it cost them
20, and sometimes 30, talents to entertain him, and
others spent even larger sums.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> These expenses were
increased by the fact that the servants took away with
them the plate used at table.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> The support of the king,
and apparently of the satraps, officers, and generals
when travelling, the maintenance of troops on the
march, were extraordinary burdens, but the contributions
for the table of the king were ordinary and
regular. The daily maintenance of the court was
expensive, because it included the support of a body-guard.
"Every day," Heraclides of Cyme relates,
"a thousand animals were slaughtered; among them
horses, camels, oxen, asses, and deer, but chiefly sheep.
Many birds were eaten, and Arabian ostriches among
them. The greater part of this and of the other food
was brought to court for the body-guard, and the
overseers gave out meat and bread in equal portions;
for as the mercenaries in Hellas receive money, so
do these soldiers receive their maintenance from the
king."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Fifteen thousand men are said to have been
fed at the court every day; and as the body-guard
may be put at 10,000 men, this statement does not
seem exaggerated.</p>

<p>Beside the contributions in kind for the equipment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
of the army, the support of garrisons and the court,
there were burdens of another kind. The kings of
Persia kept great studs for the court and army. We
have already mentioned the stud in Nisaea in Media;
150,000 or 160,000 horses are said to have pastured
there. The royal studs in Babylonia contained in
breeding horses, 800 horses and 16,000 mares&mdash;"besides
the horses for war," as Herodotus expressly adds.
The Indian dogs which were kept by Darius or his
successors were so numerous, that four great villages
in Babylonia had to contribute exclusively to their
maintenance.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> As Herodotus observes that these
villages were free from other burdens, we may assume
that all the places, on which contributions in kind
were imposed for special objects, were exempted from
the large contributions for the court and army in
horses, beasts of burden, cattle for slaughter, corn, etc.
Elsewhere we find places burdened with special
services to members of the royal house, or favourites.
Certain districts and cities had to pay for the girdle
of the queen, others for her veil; one place paid for
the head-band, another for the necklace, a third for
the hair ornaments of the queen.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Xenophon tells us
that the favourites of the king of Persia received
horses and servants in the various provinces, and
transmitted them to their descendants.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> When Demaratus,
king of Sparta, after losing his throne,
sought protection with Darius in Persia, the city of
Halisarna and the district of Teuthrania were allotted
to him. Gongylus of Eretria received from Darius
Gambrium, Myrina, and Gryneum. At a later time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
Magnesia on the Maeander was assigned to Themistocles&mdash;a
city, which, recovering from the destruction
by Mazares (p. 54), paid, according to Thucydides, a
yearly contribution of 50 talents (more than &pound;10,000)
for bread, Lampsacus, which was famous for its cultivation
of the vine, for wine, and Myus for relishes. In
this way, in accordance with the system of Cyrus and
Darius, Demaratus was made prince of Halisarna,
Gongylus became prince of Gambrium, Themistocles
prince of Magnesia; the latter also received contributions
in produce from other cities. Demaratus and
Gongylus left their thrones to their descendants.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> As
the places which had to provide contributions in
kind for special purposes or individuals were freed
from the contributions of the provinces to the army
and court&mdash;the land-tax of the places presented to
favoured persons were no doubt taken out of the
land-tax of the province.</p>

<p>We are not in a position to fix even approximately
the amount of the net income of the treasury of
Darius which came in every year over and above the
land-tax of the provinces and the tolls. Nor can we
say how high the yearly contributions in kind paid
by the provinces for the court and army ran. If we
set aside the extraordinary burdens of supporting the
king on a journey, or a satrap, or officer, and the
maintenance of troops on a march, and follow Theopompus
in assuming that the average daily expense
of the whole court amounted to 30 Babylonian talents,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
a total of 11,000 talents of the royal standard, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
more than &pound;3,000,000, would be required for this
purpose, a sum in excess of the land-tax of the
provinces. If we further assume that the maintenance
of the army imposed on the provinces a
burden equal to the maintenance of the court, the
provinces would have to pay for the state, in ordinary
burdens, without regard to their own requirements,
three times the amount of the land-tax. Egypt, which,
with Cyrene and Barca, had to pay 700 talents in
tax, would thus pay 2100 talents of royal money
every year, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> more than &pound;600,000. At a later time
we find that Ptolemy II. received each year from
Egypt 14,800 Attic talents, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> about &pound;3,000,000,
and 1,500,000 artab&egrave;s of corn, and Ptolemy Auletes
received 6000, and, according to Cicero's statement,
12,500 Attic talents.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> The income of the empire of
the Sassanids under Chosru Parviz is put at nearly
&pound;14,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>Thus the burdens which the subject lands had to
pay to the king do not seem extraordinarily heavy,
and, on the other hand, the rule of the Persians
certainly tended to promote their welfare. We have
observed that the satraps were commanded to take
care for the agriculture and the forests of their
provinces, and that special attention was paid to this
in the visitation of the provinces. In his palaces and
wherever he went the king caused the most beautiful
gardens to be made and planted with excellent trees,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
and the satraps did the same at their residences. The
parks at the residence of the satrap of Phrygia-Cappadocia,
near Dascyleum, were of great extent, consisting
in part of an enclosure for game, in part of open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
hunting-ground. When Agesilaus of Sparta had laid
them waste, the satrap Pharnabazus said to him: "All
that my father left to me, beautiful buildings, gardens
full of trees and game, which were the delight of my
heart, I now see cut down and burnt."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> At Sardis
the satraps of Lydia-Mysia had made several parks of
this kind; the most beautiful was adorned with water
and meadows, with places for recreation and shade, in
a most extraordinary and royal manner.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The younger
Cyrus enlarged this by a new park. When he showed
it to Lysander, the Greek marvelled at the beauty
of the trees, the evenness of their growth, the straight
rows and well-chosen angles in which they stood and
cut each other, the various and delightful odours
which met those who walked in it, and declared that
he admired yet more the man who had measured out
and arranged the whole. The prince replied that he
had measured it out and arranged it himself, and had
even planted some with his own hands. And when
Lysander, looking at the splendid clothes of the prince,
his chains and amulets and ornaments and perfumes,
seemed to doubt this, Cyrus replied: "I swear by
Mithra, that I never take food till I have heated
myself into a sweat by martial exercises or garden
work."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>The trade of the empire must have been very
greatly promoted by the roads which Darius made
through it in every direction. Merchandise passed
from one end of the empire to another on paved roads,
which were provided with excellent inns and secured
by numerous guard-posts. Moreover, by his royal
currency, Darius had created money which passed
from the Hellespont and the Nile to the Indus, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
thus the merchants had everywhere at hand a fixed
measure of value. The raw products which were
required by the manufacturing lands, could be bartered
in safety, on the upper Nile, in Libya and
Arabia, and on the Indus; the wide market which
the extent of the Persian kingdom opened to the
harbour cities of Asia Minor and Syria, to the industry
of the Lydians and Phenicians, the Egyptians
and Babylonians, could be used in the readiest and
most profitable manner. Ramses II. of Egypt had
conceived the idea of a direct communication by
water between the Nile and the Red Sea in order
to facilitate the trade with South Arabia. For this
object he had caused a canal to be taken from the
Nile at Bubastis, but he had only carried it as far
as the Lake of Crocodiles. Pharaoh Necho more than
700 years later had again taken up the work and
carried the canal as far as the Bitter Lakes. From
this point the canal was to abandon the direction
towards the east and turn almost at a right angle
to the south and the Red Sea. Necho failed to effect
the communication between the Bitter Lakes and the
Red Sea; and the canal remained unfinished. Herodotus,
who knew nothing of the attempt of Ramses
II., says: "Darius carried a canal from the Nile to
the Arabian Gulf."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> "Necho was the first to attempt
a canal leading into the Red Sea, and Darius accomplished
what he began. The length of the voyage
is four days, and the canal is broad enough to allow
two triremes when rowing to pass one another (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
more than 100 feet). The water of the Nile flows
into it a little above Bubastis, and empties into the
Red Sea. For the first part it is excavated in the
plain of Egypt, which lies towards Arabia, under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
mountains opposite Memphis, in which are the stone
quarries. At the foot of the mountain the canal runs
away to the east, and then through a cleft in the
range to the south, and southward, into the Arabian
Gulf. The distance from the northern sea&mdash;the Mediterranean&mdash;to
the Red Sea by the shortest route from
Pelusium<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> is 1000 stades (105 miles); but the canal
is much longer, owing to bends in it."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> In the bed
of this canal, the direction of which can still be traced
in part, three stones were discovered at Saluf El
Terraba, on the Crocodile Lake, not far from the
southern ridge of the Bitter Lakes. They have
recently been much injured by the workmen at the
Suez canal. On the front is seen the form of Darius
with the tall tiara on his head (the upper part of one
of the monuments is preserved); and beside the figure
of the king we find the name and title in hieroglyphics.
Beneath are the titles and inscriptions in
Persian, Turanian, and Babylonian; on the back
is an inscription in hieroglyphics which has been
destroyed with the exception of a word; but of the
Persian and Turanian version we can still read a part:
"Darius, the great king, the king of kings, the king
of the lands, the king of this wide earth, the son of
Hystaspes, the Ach&aelig;menid. Darius the king says:
'I, the Persian, have governed Egypt; I have caused
a canal to be dug from the river which flows in
Egypt to the sea which reaches to Persia.'" Darius
did not, like Ramses and Necho, think only of a
direct communication by water with South Arabia,
but rather of a communication with Persia, and not
only with the coasts of Persia but even with the
mouths of the Indus. His expedition to explore the
Indus did not sail back to the Persian Gulf, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
coasted Arabia and returned to the Red Sea; and
Herodotus tells us that Darius, after that expedition,
made use of the southern sea.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> After opening a road
by water into the Red Sea, Darius could, if he
thought fit, order the ships of the Ionians and Phenicians
to the coast of Arabia, the Persian Gulf, or the
Indus, and send the ships of Babylon to the Mediterranean.
Traders made a constant use of the canal; the
ships of Sidon and Tyre could sail from the Nile to the
shores of Arabia Felix, a voyage which the Phenicians
at the time of Solomon, and Uzziah of Judah, attempted
to make from Elath with the permission and assistance
of those princes. From Arabia they could visit
the mouth of the Indus, as their ships had done
nearly 500 years before at the time of Solomon.</p>

<p>However active the wearer of the crown and his
immediate supporters might be in the government
of the kingdom, however speedily their commands
were made known in the provinces&mdash;in spite of the
severity with which the satraps were watched and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
controlled, and the impulse given to their ambition
and emulation,&mdash;in spite of the excellent management
of the state income and the abundance of the means
at disposal, and the sums of gold and silver, the gold
and silver ornaments, the splendid furniture in the
royal citadels, which were in existence for nearly 200
years after this time, attest the success of Darius&mdash;the
kingdom rested in the last resort on the fidelity
and bravery of the army. In his body-guards and
in the garrisons of the fortresses and guard-posts
scattered up and down the whole kingdom, Darius
had a considerable standing army formed of Persians.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
In case of war this standing army was strengthened
by the levy of the larger landed proprietors in Persia,
who had to furnish cavalry, and the subject lands.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
Though the fortified places were numerous, the
amount of troops in the various forts was not necessarily
great, and the complement of a Persian battalion,
1000 men, seems rarely to have been exceeded.
The garrison of the oldest city in the empire, the
White Fortress at Memphis, was much stronger, and
so, no doubt, were the garrisons of the two citadels
of Babylon and of Ecbatana. In the west Dascyleum
on the Propontis, and Sardis, the citadel of which was
held by 1000 men, were the extreme points; in the
interior there were so many garrisons at Celaenae,
on the bridge over the Halys, and at other places
west of the Halys, that a considerable army could
be formed for service in the field.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> East of the Halys,
in Cilicia, there was the garrison of the two forts on
the borders of Cilicia and Cappadocia, and in addition
a body of cavalry which it cost 140 talents (&pound;40,000)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
a year to support. The citadels and fortresses which
the inscriptions of Darius mention in Armenia, Media,
Persia, and Arachosia, show that there was a certain
number of fortified places in those regions. In
Armenia Tigra and Uhyama are mentioned; in Media
Ecbatana and &Ccedil;ikathauvatis; in Arachosia Kapisakanis
(Kapisa) and Arsada. The chief points in the
royal road from Susa to Sardis at the most important
divisions in the country were closed by fortresses, and
the same was the case on the other military roads;
we cannot therefore doubt that the military arrangements
in the eastern provinces were the same as in
the west, though the Greeks can only tell us of the
west. Lastly, there was a number of fortresses at the
extreme borders of the kingdom. In Egypt, in addition
to Memphis, Daphne and Elephantine were
fortified;<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> in the country of the Cadusians Cyrus had
already founded the city on the Jaxartes known as
<i>Ultima Cyrus</i>, and in the neighbourhood were several
citadels to protect the borders (p. 103). Besides the
garrisons, the amount of troops was fixed which the
satraps had to keep under arms, to support their
authority, to carry out executions, and to secure the
provinces.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Like the garrisons, the troops of the
satraps, in case of necessity, could fall back on the
assistance of the reserve corps of larger districts,
such as the Cilician cavalry. The troops stationed
in the provinces were reviewed yearly, as Xenophon
tells us. For this object they were gathered together
at a fixed place in the provinces, with the exception
of the garrisons of the fortresses. For the more
western districts the place of assembly was Thymbrara
on the Pactolus,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> where also, in time of war, the levy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
of the province was assembled. The troops which
were nearer the residence of the king, were, according
to Xenophon, inspected by the king in person; those
at a greater distance by men in his confidence. The
satraps, chiliarchs, and commandants, who brought
up the prescribed number of troops provided with
excellent weapons and horses, were rewarded by
presents and marks of distinction; those who neglected
their troops or made money out of them were
severely punished and removed from their office.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>From Herodotus we learn that the guard of the
king consisted of 2000 selected Persian horsemen and
2000 lance-bearers on foot, whose lances were adorned
at the lower end with apples of gold and silver, and
also of a division of 10,000 infantry, whom the
Persians call the immortals, because their number is
always the same. But the name of the corps may
be formed from the Amesha &Ccedil;penta Ameretat (V. 156,
164). Xenophon ascribes this institution to Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
Nine thousand of them had silver pomegranates on
their lances, but a thousand who were selected from
the whole corps to form the first battalion had their
pomegranates of gold. On the monuments they carry
lances taller than the height of a man, and oval
shields of half a man's height. This troop was distinguished
as the body-guard of the king by golden
necklaces and other ornaments; it was better furnished
than other troops with beasts of burden and
camels to carry the baggage and the provisions. Later
writers speak only of these 10,000 infantry as forming
the guard. They inform us that the corps was always
about the king, keeping watch in the palace day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
and night, where they had a court to themselves;
they accompanied the king on his journeys, when
they camped in a circle round the king's tent.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> The
amount of the whole army cannot even be approximately
fixed. Darius led the levy of the empire over
the Bosphorus to the amount of 700,000 men; from
the subject lands so many soldiers would be required
as would be necessary.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> It was more difficult to
organize this vast mass. The strength of the army,
like that of the kingdom, rested on the military skill
and superiority of the Persians. With the Persians,
as with the Indians, the chief weapon was the bow,
and the Persian arrows like the Indian were of
reed. Aeschylus praises "the mighty with the bow,
the strength of the Persian land," and Atossa, the
queen of Darius, is represented as asking whether
"the bow-driven arrow adorns the hand" of the
Hellenes.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The Persians preferred to fight on horseback.
The rider placed a coat of mail over the short
shirt, and beside the bow and a short javelin carried
a crooked and not very long sabre on the right hip;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
the head was protected by the tiara. But there were
also large divisions of heavy armed cavalry among
the troops of the Persians in which the men wore
brass or iron helmets and strong harness, while their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
horses were armed with frontlets and breast-pieces.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
The infantry carried long rectangular shields of wicker-work,
under which hung the quiver with the javelin
and sabre, but as a rule they were without coats of
mail.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The leading men and officers were adorned
in battle with their best purple robes, neck-chains,
and armlets; over the coat of mail they threw the
glittering kandys; on the hip hung a sabre with a
golden handle and a golden sheath. Thus they
mounted their war-horses, Nisaean greys, with golden
trappings, the wildness of which sometimes caused
the death of the rider. Aeschylus speaks of them as
"horsemen mighty with the bow, dreadful to behold,
and terrible in the venturous courage of their hearts."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
In military skill the Persians regarded the Medes as
next to themselves; then followed the Sacae, the
Bactrians, the Indians, and the other Arian tribes.
Next to the Medes the Sacae were the most trustworthy
troops.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The contingents of the provinces
were governed by Persian generals, who were mainly
taken from the members of the royal family, the
"kinsmen" of the king, and the tribal princes.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Like
the Persian troops, these contingents were arranged
in divisions of 10,000 men. Each division was subdivided
into ten battalions of 1000 men, and the
battalions into ten companies of 100 men; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
company was made up of groups, which, according to
Xenophon, consisted of seven men among the Persians,
and according to Herodotus of ten in the contingents.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
The commander of the entire contingent of a province
had the nomination of the officers of divisions and
the leaders of battalions; the officers of divisions,
as Herodotus says, nominated the captains of companies,
and the leaders of the groups.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The native
dynasts as a rule marched out with their troops and
ships, but they were subject to the commanders of
the contingents.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>The king reviewed the army from his war-chariot,
surrounded by scribes, who wrote down everything
worthy of notice. When parading before the king,
the horsemen dismounted, stood by their horses, and
concealed their hands in the sleeves of their kandys.
The camp was always pitched in a particular order;
the tent of the king was on the eastern side, for the
abode of the gods was in the east. The large and
splendid tent of the king was surrounded by the tents
of the guard; the cavalry, the infantry, and the
baggage had special places assigned to them.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> They
understood how to fortify the camp;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> an open camp
was always at a certain distance, about seven miles,
from the enemy in order to avoid surprises as far as
possible. The Persian cavalry required a considerable
time, especially at night, for preparation. Their spirited
horses had not only to be tethered, but even tied by
the feet to prevent their running away. The unfettering,
saddling and bridling of the horses, and putting
on the harness, took up much time, and could not be
done at night without disorder and confusion.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
there was danger of a surprise the troops had to
remain at night under arms. The signal for marching
was given from the royal tent with the trumpet, but
never before daybreak,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> "before the glittering Mithra
mounted, and in golden shape seized the beautiful summits,"
the army of the Persians was not to move. In
the same way the march ended at the latest at sunset.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
In battle the king occupied the centre of the position,
surrounded by the Ach&aelig;menids, the "kinsmen" and
"companions," several hundred in number,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> and the
body-guard, the cavalry of which usually stood in
the first ranks before the king; next to them in the
centre came the best troops in the army.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> According
to ancient custom the king generally fought from a
chariot drawn by Nisaean horses,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> with his bow in
his hand, in which manner, at an earlier period, the
princes of the Indians had fought, and the kings of
the east, the Pharaohs, the rulers of Assyria, and the
princes of the Syrians. The king also, when in battle,
wore all his royal ornaments, the purple kaftan over
his armour, and the royal tiara. Near him was the
ensign of the empire, the golden eagle on a tall pole.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
The mass of the cavalry was generally placed on the
wings; between these and the centre were the contingents
of the subject nations, each according to its
divisions, which were drawn up separately in solid
squares.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> The battle was begun by the cavalry and
infantry with a thick shower of arrows. With this
an attempt was made to ward off the attacks of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
enemy, and it was kept up till the enemy seemed
to be thrown into confusion. Then the troops were
brought closer; javelins were hurled and sabres
drawn.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The Persian and Sacian cavalry was most
dreaded; as it consisted to a great extent of archers
it was difficult to approach it. If the cavalry marched
to the attack with arms in rest, the onset was made
first with separate squadrons, and then in entire
masses.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> The Medes and Persians had learned the
art of siege from the Assyrians.  The cities were
enclosed by ramparts, and on these works were carried
forward, under the protection of which battering-rams
were brought to bear against the trenches and walls.
The Persians were also well acquainted with mining.
Passages were carried under-ground, both to make
breaches in the walls by excavations, and to provide
a way into the city. In order to recapture Chalcedon,
which had rebelled against Darius when he crossed
the Danube against the Scythians, together with the
cities of the Propontis and Hellespont, an under-ground
passage of more than 15 stades in length was
carried, after the king's return, under the walls of
the city to the market-place, and the Chalcedonians
had no suspicion of its existence, till the Persians
appeared in the city.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_369_369" id="Footnote_369_369"></a><a href="#FNanchor_369_369"><span class="label">[369]</span></a> In his "Metrological Studies" B&ouml;ckh fixed the ratio of the
Euboean to the Babylonian talent as 5:6. Since that time the
discovery of numerous gold and silver Persian coins and of weights
at Babylon and Nineveh, and the lion of Abydus with its Aramaean
stamp, have provided the means for fixing the gold talent of Darius
at 25,245 kilogrammes, and his silver talent (the Babylonian talent)
at 33,660 kilogrammes; Brandis, "M&uuml;nzwesen," s. 54, 63, 64, 69.
Hence Brandis takes Mommsen's view, that in Herod. 3, 89, 95, we
must read 78 instead of 70 Euboean talents; the Euboean talent in
Attica was a little heavier than the light Babylonian talent (the gold
talent of Darius), and in the calculation 7600 Babylonian talents must
be made equal to 9880 Euboean talents, which enables us to preserve
the total sum given by Herodotus&mdash;14,560 talents.</p></div>

"Chronol." s. 354, and "Monatsberichte B. A." 1866, s. 288; Oppert,
"M&eacute;moires prs. &agrave; l'Acad. des Inscrip." 1, 8 (1869), p. 646 ff. In
opposition to the definite and detailed assertion of Herodotus, given in
the text, the assertion in Strabo (p. 804) and Diodorus (1, 33) that
Darius nearly finished the canal but did not quite finish it, cannot be
accepted. Herodotus was in Egypt not much more than 30 years
after the death of Darius (about 450 <small>B.C.</small>). Diodorus and Strabo
accept the tradition of the times of the Ptolemies, which sought to
claim for them the glory of completing the work, though they did no
more than reopen the canal which had become silted up. To support
this tradition Oppert has supplemented the decisive word of which no
more than the syllable <i>ta</i> remains, according to his transcription, in
such a way that the meaning extracted is that Darius filled up his own
canal. I do not see why this <i>ta</i> should not be a part of <i>u&ccedil;taka</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to
excavate, as well as of <i>vikata</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to make level. We cannot assume
without further evidence that Darius set up a monument over the failure
of his undertaking or its destruction. The Turanian version, which
Oppert has since published ("Peuple des M&egrave;des," p. 214) does not help
us to a decision, for it is only preserved as far as the place in question.</p></div>

in the inscriptions of Behistun allow us to conclude that the population
of Iran was far greater. Under the Ptolemies Egypt, consisting of
about 30,000 communities, counted 7,000,000 inhabitants; Diod. 1, 31.
That Asia Minor was not less populous is proved, for certain districts,
by the statements of Xenophon; the budget of Darius, the numbers of
his army, and more especially of the army of Xerxes, the mass of
troops which the younger Cyrus collects in Asia Minor and Artaxerxes
in the Eastern provinces, are evidence of a tolerably dense population.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>THE COURT OF DARIUS.</h3>


<p>Along with the new arrangement of the administration
of the empire Darius had transferred the
centre of it into a province, which had thrice rebelled
against him, to Susa,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> the ancient metropolis of Elam,
which Assurbanipal had conquered, plundered, and
destroyed 130 years previously. Since that time the
city had risen from its ruins. We have seen what
motives determined Darius to take this step. The
position of the city, which was not far removed from
his native territory, and at the same time brought
the stubborn resistance of the Babylonians under the
close pressure of the royal residence, offered the
requisite security. Out of Media, from the southern
foot of the Mount Elvend (Orontes), the Kerkha, or
Choaspes, flows down the heights which bound Iran
on the west, towards the south-west; and then
breaks through them in order to fall into the Tigris.
Further to the east is the Dizful. Rising more to the
south than the Kerkha it reaches the plains of Elam in
a course parallel to that stream and then falls also
into the Tigris. Between these two rivers there rises
in the mountain edge the Shapur, a river of a short
and narrow course, but with a deep channel. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
a time it flows in the same direction with the others,
then it turns to the east, and falls into the Dizful,
or rather into the Karun, as the Dizful is now called
in its lower course, after the affluent which falls into
it from the east. At the point where the Kerkha and
Dizful approach within two or three leagues of each
other,&mdash;though lower down they separate more and
more widely,&mdash;about half a league from the east bank
of the Kerkha, and on the eastern side of the Shapur,
is the city of Susa. The approach from the west was
barred by the Kerkha, and from the east by the
Dizful and its affluents. If an enemy came from
the west or the east, he had to cross considerable
rivers. The great road which ran from the west
from Sardis to Susa, came to an end opposite Susa on
the west bank of the Kerkha. According to Herodotus
the city could only be reached by a ferry across the
river. This was no doubt an arrangement for security.
An approaching enemy was not to find bridges either
on the Kerkha or the Dizful.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Thus irrigated by three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
rivers, the land round the city was extraordinarily
fruitful and blooming.</p>

<p>The Greeks were right in calling Susa "the ancient
great city." Though it was not, as they imagined,
at one time the abode of Memnon, the son of
the morning, who had come to the help of the
Trojans, we have made acquaintance with the ancient
kingdom of Elam, the beginnings of which we had
to place about the year 2500 <small>B.C.</small> We saw that
the princes of this kingdom could make war upon
Babylonia, and reduce it to dependence in the last
centuries of the third millennium <small>B.C.</small>, and that its
armies must have reached Syria. Then Elam had
withstood the Assyrians for a long time with very great
stubbornness, until at length after brave struggles
it succumbed to the arms of Assurbanipal. A relief
in the palace of Assurbanipal exhibited Susa before
its capture, in the year 645 <small>B.C.</small>, stretching along
between two rivers (the Shapur and the Dizful), and
surrounded by high walls and numerous towers. The
new Susa also, the Susa of Darius and his successors,
extended, according to the evidence of Strabo, between
the two rivers; according to his statement the city
had a circuit of 120 stades, and according to Diodorus
of 200 stades, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of 15 or 20 miles&mdash;an extent which
does not leave it far behind the fallen cities of the
Assyrians, and Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> But Susa, which in spite
of its numerous population was inhabited only to a
small extent by Persians, required to be fortified even
less than Ecbatana. The royal citadel must keep the
city in check, and afford the most complete security<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
to the palace. We are expressly told that this citadel
was protected by strong works, which would indeed
be necessary for the position of affairs and the object
of Darius.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> According to the statement of Pliny,
the citadel was surrounded by the Eulaeus, the name
which he gives to the Choaspes; the Book of Daniel
also represents the Ulai as flowing round the castle
of Susa.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The ruins prove that the palace lay on
the Shapur. Within the protecting walls of the
fortress was the "golden dwelling," "the gold-adorned
chambers of Darius" as Aeschylus calls them,<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> the
"far-famed palace" in the language of Diodorus.
According to Aelian Darius took a pride in the buildings
which he had erected at Susa; it was he who
had erected the famous works there.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>The ruins of Susa are now surrounded by a wilderness,
inhabited only by lions and hy&aelig;nas. The
soil is still productive of grass, and the remains
of numerous canals attest the ancient cultivation.
Steep mounds of d&eacute;bris and heaps of ruins rise thickly
on the left bank of the Shapur, in appearance closely
resembling the remains of Babylon and Nineveh.
The highest mound is nearest the river; it rises 120
feet above the level of the water, is 3000 feet in
circumference, and appears to have supported a part
of the citadel; the mound abutting on the north
only rises 80 or 90 feet, and forms a square, the
sides of which measure 1000 or 1200 feet. On this
the remains of a large building have been discovered.
Further to the east is an extensive platform, the
circumference of which far surpasses that of the two
first put together; the height on the south side
reaches 70 feet and on the east and north about 50<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
feet. On the east of these three heaps are mounds
of a smaller size. These may be remains of the city,
while the others represent the citadel. The entire
circuit of the ruins is about 7&frac12; miles. They confirm
the statement of Strabo that Susa was built of brick,
inasmuch as they present masses of bricks, partly
burnt, partly dried in the sun. But even the palaces
in the citadels were built of bricks in the outer
walls only; they did not contain those narrow long
porticoes, which formed the royal palaces of Nineveh,
but were rather large square halls, resting on huge
terraces. The bases and remains of the northern hill
allow us to trace three magnificent porticoes. The
interior of the building was formed by a large hall
with pillars, the roof of which was supported by
36 pillars ranged in six rows; the pillars were of
stone, slight and tall, the capitals were formed by
the fore-quarters of kneeling horses. Round three
sides of this hall, the north, east, and west, were
placed porticoes, 50 feet in breadth, the roofs of which
were supported by 12 pillars in two rows. Four
pillars of the chief hall bear the same inscription in
cuneiform letters, and, as always, in the Persian,
Babylonian, and Turanian languages. In this Artaxerxes
Mnemon (405-359 <small>B.C.</small>) relates that his great-great-grandfather
(<i>apanyaka</i>) Darius had erected this
building and that he had restored it. He entreats
Auramazda, Anahita, and Mithra, to protect him and
his work. On some pillars we find the inscription:
"I, Artaxerxes, the great king, the king of kings, son
of the king Darius" (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Darius Ochus).<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>Though Darius elevated Susa to be his chief residence,
the native land of the empire, and the nucleus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
of it, his own home, was to receive a proper share of
the splendour and glory of the court. After the
conquests on the Indus Darius built a new residence
in the land of the Persians, to the north-west of
Pasargadae, which Cyrus had made a fortified city,
and where he had erected his palace and deposited
the spoil of his previous victories. At the confluence
of the Pulwar and the Kum-i-Firuz the mountains
retire on either side, and leave a space for the most
delightful plain in Persia, which is still covered with
villages,&mdash;the plain of Merdasht. Four thousand feet
above the sea, surrounded on every side by lofty
mountains, which on the west are covered with snow,
the climate is mild and salubrious. Curtius considers
it the most healthy district in Asia.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> From the
mountain-range on the west, a block of mountains
now called Kuh Istachr advances into the plain, and
gradually falls away to the Pulwar; opposite to this,
the eastern range also advances with a mighty summit,
called Rachmed, a spur of which, at no great
height, forms a broad terrace commanding the plain.
On both sides the heights extend a little further to
the river, so that the terrace forms the retiring level
of a natural semicircle. This terrace was chosen by
Darius for the site of his new palace, by the walls
of which a city was to rise. The Greeks call this
city of Darius, Persepolis; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> city of the Persians.
Diodorus tells us: "The citadel of Persepolis was
surrounded by three walls, of which the first was 16
cubits in height and surrounded by turrets, adorned
with costly ornamentation. The second wall had
similar ornaments, but was twice as high. The
third wall formed a square, and was 60 cubits
in height; it consisted of hard stones, well fitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
together, so as to last for ever. On each side was
a gate of brass, and near it poles of brass, 20 cubits
in height; the first for security, the second to strike
terror. In the citadel were several richly-adorned
buildings for the reception of the king and the
generals, and treasuries built for the reception of
revenues. To the east of the citadel, at a distance
of four plethra, lies a mountain, called the "royal
mountain," in which are the tombs of the kings. The
rock was excavated, and had several chambers in the
middle, which served to receive the corpses. But
they were without any means of access; the corpses
were raised by machines and lowered into the tombs.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>"</p>

<p>The remains of Persepolis show that the terrace
was surrounded on the west, north, and south by a
wall; and that by removing the earth or filling it in
it was changed into a surface measuring about 1800
feet in length from north to south, and about 500
feet in breadth from west to east, towards the heights
of Rachmed. On the edge of the terrace rose a wall,
the third wall of Diodorus, which surrounded it on
the north, west, and south. According to the description
of Diodorus, the eastern side, towards Rachmed,
was also surrounded by this wall. At the present day
we only find remains of the three sides mentioned,
consisting of blocks of marble from four to six feet
in thickness, which in some places rise to a height
of 40 feet above the level of the terrace. If we
reckon in the height of the terrace, those walls had
certainly the elevation of 60 cubits which Diodorus
gives them. The two other walls were on the plain,
and barred the approach to the palace; of these there
are no remains. Within the third wall, on the terrace,
rise the buildings of the palace. An inscription on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
the wall of the terrace in the Turanian language tells
us: "Darius the king says: On this place a fortress
is founded; previously there was no fortress. By
the grace of Auramazda I have founded this fortress,
strong, beautiful, and complete. May Auramazda
and all the gods protect me and this fortress and
all that is in it."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> On the western side of the terrace
towards the northern edge, two flights of steps,
receding into the terrace, and joining at the top,
lead up to the surface and the gate of the palace.
They consist of 200 broad steps of large blocks of
marble, ten or fifteen steps being sometimes formed out
of one block. Ten horsemen could easily ride up together
on each side. On the top of the terrace behind
the landing of the steps, there was a gate in the wall,
the place of which can be found by a break in the
ruins; through this was the entrance into the citadel.</p>

<p>Not far from the western edge of the terrace, about
equally removed from the northern and southern
walls, on an elevated platform, rose a structure, 170
feet in length, and 90 feet in breadth; only a few
fragments of the walls, door-posts, and window-cases
remain, with the bases of the pillars in the hall
(24 in number) which formed the centre of the
building. On the window-ledges of the building is
an inscription in three languages, in which we read:
"Darius (Darayavus), the great king, the king of
kings, the king of the lands, the son of Hystaspes, an
Ach&aelig;menid, has erected this house."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> On a pilaster
in the south-west corner we find an inscription of
Xerxes which tells us: "Under the protection of
Auramazda, Darius, my father, erected this house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
The relief of one of the two posts of the door, which
forms the entrance to the central hall on the north,
exhibits Darius himself. The figure is 7&frac12; feet high.
The king is dressed in a garment which falls down
to the ancles; the sleeves are very wide; he has
high shoes, and wears the tiara; in his left hand
he holds a long sceptre, and in the right a cup-shaped
vessel. The beard is long, the hair comes out in
strong locks under the tiara; the face is so injured
that little more can be recognized beyond the long
profile, the straight outline of the nose, and the quiet
dignity of expression. Both the lines of the face
and the expression correspond to the head of the
king preserved on the memorial stone of the canal
(p. 358). Over the king in a winged circle hovers
Auramazda, whose figure from the knees upward projects
from the circle beneath which the long robe of the
god runs out in feathers. He wears a tiara like the king
and in the left hand bears a ring. The countenance
is aged and solemn; the hair and beard are like those
of the king. The figure of the deity is obviously
copied from the Asshur which hovers over the kings
of Assyria. Behind the king, in similar clothing, but
with much smaller and lower tiaras on the head, are
the bearer of the royal parasol, which he holds over
the head of the king, and the bearer of the fan.</p>

<p>The largest structure lies to the east, near the
height of Rachmed. It forms a regular square of
more than 200 (227) feet on each side, on which, on
the north side, abutted a portico formed of two rows
of pillars. The outer walls of the square consist of
blocks of marble neatly fitted together, and more than
ten feet in thickness. Eight gates, two towards each
quarter, on the posts of which stand two lance-bearers
face to face, led into a large hall the roof of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
was supported by 100 pillars, ten in ten rows.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> At
the north entrance to the portico, in the two western
doors of the hall, the king is represented in conflict
with monsters. In these reliefs he is shown with
only a narrow band round the brow, or he wears a
low cap; his robe is short, his arms are bare. He
raises a lion with his right hand and presses the
throat, while in his left he holds a dagger; he seizes
a winged one-horned monster with the jaws of a wolf
and the legs of a bird by the horn, and rips up the
belly;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> the third monster has the head and the claws
of an eagle; the fourth is a four-footed animal standing
up, with a horn in the forehead, which the king
seizes, while with his left hand he has already thrust
the sword into the body. These pictures are, no
doubt, like the human-headed bulls which Xerxes
subsequently set up at Persepolis, imitations of
Semitic symbols. The overpowering or slaughter of
the lion was, among the Assyrians, Cilicians, and
Lydians, an ancient mode of representing the greatest
achievement of Melkart-Sandon&mdash;the conquest of the
fierce heat. This victory over evil was easily and
naturally transferred to the office of the ruler, and
could be accepted, even among the Iranians, as the
religion of the Avesta rests in its principles on the
resistance to the evil spirits of Angromainyu and the
contest with his savage and harmful creatures, and
requires this contest. The great hall of 100 pillars
was, as the sculptures of the walls and posts show,
the royal hall of audience. The throne was between
the two central rows of pillars, opposite the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
doors of the north, on the southern wall of the hall.
Here, on days of reception and festivity, the whole
splendour of the Persian empire was displayed. Then,
as the book of Esther says; "golden and silver cushions
were laid on the floor of marble and alabaster, of
pearls and tortoise-shell"; and "between the pillars
hung white and purple curtains, on rings of silver, and
linen and purple strings," and "wine was poured in
abundance from golden vessels."<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The walls of this
room, and the beams of the roof, would not be without
that ornamentation of gold and silver plates, which
covered the walls, pillars, and beams of the chambers
of the palace of Ecbatana (V. 309). The metal bolts
which are found here and there on the inner side of
the walls, can hardly have had any other purpose
than to support plates of this kind. In both the
northern gates two reliefs exhibit Darius sitting on
the throne, on a lofty chair with a still higher back.
The feet of the king rest on a stool; he wears the
tiara, and has the sceptre in his right hand, a goblet
in his left. Behind him is the bearer of the fan with
a covered mouth, that his impure breath might not
touch the king, then the bow-bearer without the
Paitidana (V. 190), and at a greater distance one of
the body-guard. A foreign emissary approaches the
throne, clad in a tight coat with sleeves, and trousers
joined to it, with a rounded cap. He holds his hand
before his mouth while speaking to the king; behind
him stands another figure with veiled mouth. This
group of figures rests on a pediment which is formed
by four rows of ten guards placed one over the
other. These are armed partly with bows and lances,
and partly with shields and lances. Their clothing
exhibits two types; which often recur on the monu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>ments
of Persepolis. In the three lower rows one
half of the men have wide coats reaching down to
the ancles, with large sleeves, and high angular tiaras;
the other half have coats with tight sleeves, reaching
to the knee only, trowsers joined to them, and a low
round covering for the head. This appears to be the
Persian dress, the other is the dress of the Medes.
Over the throne of the king a canopy with hanging
fringes encloses the whole picture; except that in
the middle, two winged circles are seen; beside the
lower rows of figures on each side are four dogs (the
animals of Auramazda); and beside the upper four
bulls may be seen on each side. This picture of the
enthroned king is repeated on the pilasters of the
two southern gates; but on the third relief we find
only Darius on the throne, with the fan-bearer
behind; and the throne is not supported by the rows
of guards, but on fourteen figures of another shape
which are arranged in three rows; in the highest row
are four figures, in the two lower five; in the last
figure on the lowest row towards the west, there is
an unmistakable negro. They bear the throne of the
king with raised arms; above the two winged rings
is the picture of Auramazda. On the fourth relief
is some dignitary of the empire, or a prince of the
house, behind the throne of the king, which is here
supported in the same way by twenty-nine figures
arranged in three rows. Here also Auramazda hovers
over the two winged circles.</p>

<p>These figures are intended to present a picture of
the government of Darius as resting in the one case
on the fidelity and bravery of the army, and in the
other, on the obedience of the subject nations. The
supporting figures of the southern doors are all clothed
differently, in the various dresses of the empire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Between these doors we find the following inscription:
"The great Auramazda, who is the greatest of gods,
has made Darius king. He has given him the kingdom;
by the grace of Auramazda Darius is king.
Darius the king speaks: 'This land of Persia, which
Auramazda has given to me, which is beautiful, rich
in horses and men, fears no enemy by the protection
of Auramazda, and of me, King Darius. May Auramazda
stand beside me with the gods of the land,
and protect this region against war, blight, and the
lie. May no enemy come to this region, no army,
no blight, no lie. For this favour I entreat Auramazda,
and all the gods. May Auramazda grant me
this with all the gods.'" On the same wall we are
told: "I am Darius, the great king, the king of
kings, the king of these numerous lands, the son of
Hystaspes, an Ach&aelig;menid. Darius the king says:
'By the grace of Auramazda these are the lands which
I rule over with this Persian army, which are in fear
of me, and bring me tribute: the Susians, the Medes,
the Babylonians, the Arabs, the Assyrians, the Egyptians,
the Armenians, the Cappadocians, the inhabitants
of Sardis, the Ionians of the mainland, and those of
the sea. And in the east the Sagartians, the Parthians,
the Sarangians, the Areians, the Bactrians,
the Sogdiani, the Chorasmians, the Gedrosians, the
Arachoti, the Indians, the Gandarians, the Sacae, the
Macians. If thou thinkest: May I tremble before no
enemy, then protect this Persian army; if the Persian
army is protected, prosperity will remain unbroken
to the most distant days.'"<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>The successors of Darius extended the palace of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
Persepolis. Directly behind the gate to which the
great staircase on the terrace leads, King Xerxes, the
son and successor of Darius, erected a portico. From
the two front pilasters which form the entrance to
this court from the west, two horses are hewn out
in high relief; their heads and fore-feet project in
front, their bodies and hinder quarters stand out from
the pilasters in the entrance. These horses are 18
feet in length. From the four pillars which support
the roof of the portico behind this entrance,
two are still standing, 24 feet in height. Corresponding
to the two guards of the front entrances,
we find at the exit of the hall towards the interior
of the citadel, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> towards the east, two winged bulls
with human heads, projecting from the pilasters.
About 20 feet in length, these bulls are precisely
similar to the human-headed bulls of Nineveh, but
the wings of the bulls are not thrown back so far,
and the solemn bearded head is not surmounted here
by a round cap, but by the Persian tiara; these tiaras,
like the caps at Nineveh, are surrounded by four
united horns. The horse, the animal of Mithra,
which occurs repeatedly on the ruins of Persepolis,
was no doubt the peculiar symbol of the Persians;
the human-headed winged bulls belong, as has been
observed, to Babylon and Assyria. Between this
portico and the smaller building of his father, on
the western edge of the terrace, Xerxes constructed
a magnificent building. Three porticoes, of twelve
pillars each, surrounded on the north, west, and south,
a hall, formed of 36 pillars of black marble, 67 feet
in height, and placed closely to each other in six
rows; 14 are still standing. The building rose upon
a walled platform, paved with blocks of marble. This
appears to have been a kind of vestibule in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
the court, the foreign ambassadors, the emissaries of
the provinces, who brought tribute, assembled. The
inscription calls it a reception-house,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and the reliefs
with which the front wall of the platform, ten feet
in height, is ornamented, indicate that it was a vestibule.
Two flights of steps lead up to this platform,
and in the middle they form a projecting landing,
on the front of which, on either side of an inscription,
stand the seven guardians of the kingdom, three on
one side and four on the other, in Median garments,
with an upright spear in the hand. On the external
walls of the steps we see a lion on either side, which
attacks a horned horse from behind; the horse turns
to defend itself. On the wall of the platform reliefs
on either side of the steps exhibit three rows of
figures one above the other. On the west side are
the nations bringing tribute, on the eastern, which
is more honourable, the body-guard and the court
of the king. In each row here 22 soldiers of the
body-guard advance to the steps; then the people
of the court follow, partly in Median and partly in
Persian dress; most of them have a dagger at the
side; some are in conversation and take each other
by the hand; others have suspended the bow in a
belt over the shoulder; others carry cups, others
staves which end in an apple in their hands. On
the west side of the steps the figures are arranged
in 20 sections, each containing six men (with one
exception, which contains eight). The first figure
always carries a staff, which marks him out as introducing
strangers. The staff-bearer holds the nearest
man by the hand; this second figure and the four
which follow are differently clad in each section; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
last four carry various objects, garments, jars containing
different articles, etc., or lead camels, horses,
humped oxen, cattle, rams, mules, and other animals.
These are the 20 satrapies of the kingdom who are
brought before the king by the officers, and present
their tribute. A second building, which Xerxes
erected to the south-west of the smaller structure of
Darius, consists of a portico of 12 pillars, and a hall
of 36 pillars, on which abut four chambers on the
east and west. This seems to have been his dwelling-house
at Persepolis; at any rate we see in the
sculptures of the hall six servants, who are carrying
dishes with food, and a wine-skin. In addition to
these, in four other places on the terrace, there are
remains of less extensive buildings, one of which,
lying in the south-west angle, was built by Artaxerxes
III. Numerous ruins before the royal citadel, reaching
from the foot of the terrace to the Pulwar, and
the ruins of a wall, which ran along the river, confirm
the statements of the Greeks, that a city of considerable
size lay adjacent to the palace, just as the
remains of canals and aqueducts show that the valley
in front of the citadel was carefully cultivated.</p>

<p>Near the new citadel and city, which Darius added
to his home a few years later, he caused the place
to be marked out in which his corpse should rest
or be exposed. Two leagues to the north-west from
the ruins of the citadel of Persepolis, on the further
shore of the Pulwar, lies a steep wall of white marble,
now called Naksh-i-Rustem, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> pictures of Rustem.
At an elevation of 60 or 70 feet above the ground
this wall is hewn and wrought. The lowest part of
this work is a plain surface, which forms the basis
for a fa&ccedil;ade of four pillars, which are cut out of
the rock. The capitals, like those in the palaces of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Persepolis, are formed of the fore-quarters of two
kneeling horses united at the middle. Between the
two central pillars is the case of a door. The heavy
moulding which these pillars support passes into a
toothed plinth, on which rises a sort of catafalque, where
are two rows of men, each containing fourteen, in
different dresses (among them are three negroes), who
support a beam with upraised arms, on which a few
steps lead up to a platform. On this stands Darius
before an altar, the fire on which is flaming. The left
hand rests on the bow which is planted on the platform,
the right is raised in prayer. In the centre above
the king hovers Auramazda in a winged circle; to
the right the sun's disc is visible. The door of the
fa&ccedil;ade does not seem to have been an entrance; but
now the lower part of it is opened, and leads behind
the fa&ccedil;ade into a long chamber, and three smaller
ones, which are cut out of the mountain. Any one
who wishes to have a near view of the fa&ccedil;ade must
be drawn up, as Ctesias says that the parents of
Darius were; the corpses also must have been drawn
up, as we are told by Diodorus. On the fa&ccedil;ade
under the form of the king we find the following
inscription: "I, Darius, the great king, the king of
kings, the king of the lands of all tongues, the king
of the great and wide earth, the son of Hystaspes,
the Ach&aelig;menid, the Persian, the son of a Persian,
Ariya, scion of Ariya (in the Babylonia text we have
only, a Persian, son of a Persian). Darius the king
says: 'By the grace of Auramazda these are the
lands which I governed beyond Persia; I ruled over
them: they brought me tribute, they did what I
commanded them: they obeyed my law: the Medes,
Susians, Parthians, Areans, Bactrians, Sogdians, Chorasmians,
Sarangians, Arachoti, Gedrosians, Gandarians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Indians, Amyrgian-Sac&aelig;, Sac&aelig; with pointed caps,
Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Egypt, Armenia, Cappadocia,
the inhabitants of Sardis, the Ionians, the Sac&aelig;

Ionians who wear knots,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> the Putiya, the Kushiya,
the Machiya, the Karka (p. 307). Auramazda gave
me these lands when he saw them in rebellion, and
granted to me the rule over them; by the grace of
Auramazda I have again reduced them to order;
what I told them, that was done, because it was my
will. If thou thinkest: How many were the lands
which Darius ruled? look on the picture of those
who bear my throne, in order to know them. Then
wilt thou know that the lance of the Persian penetrated
far, that the Persian fought battles far from
Persia. What I have done, I have accomplished by
the grace of Auramazda: Auramazda came to my
help, till I accomplished it; may Auramazda protect
me, my house and my land. May Auramazda grant
me that for which I pray. O man, resist not the
command of Auramazda; leave not the right path;
sin not.'"<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> The mention of the "Knot-bearing"
Ionians, and the Putiya (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Libyans), and the
Sac&aelig; beyond the sea on this inscription shows that it
was engraved after the campaigns to the Danube and
Barca, the subjection of Lemnos and Miletus, and the
Greek cities on the coast of Thracia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> after the
year 512 <small>B.C.</small>; it was after this year that Darius
caused his tomb to be constructed.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> On the frame
of the fa&ccedil;ade, over the pillared portal, we find on
each side three figures in long robes placed over
each other. These are the six princes of the Persian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
tribes, the six chiefs of the empire after the king.
Above the highest figure on the left of the king we
read: "Gaubaruva (Gobryas) the Pateischorean, the
lance-bearer of King Darius;"<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> over the second

<p>The ruins of Susa and Persepolis, the only remains
of ancient west Iranian architecture which have come
down to us, show that it was indeed founded upon
Babylonian and Assyrian patterns, but that it was
by no means mere imitation. Neither in Ecbatana
nor in Persepolis was the use of brick necessary;
stone was at hand; and even in Susa, at a distance
of 50 miles from the mountains, stone was used. The
ruins give evidence of a skill in smoothing and fitting
the stones, which can only have been attained by
long practice. If the platform, on which the buildings
rest, belongs to the Babylonian and Assyrian
style, the ruins of Persepolis and Susa nevertheless
exhibit a perfectly independent style, which seems
to have arisen out of an earlier practice of building
in wood, and a peculiar manner of treating the ornamentation.
We have seen that the plan of the palace
at Ecbatana presupposed the use of wood, that the
pillars there were wooden posts covered with precious
metals. In Persepolis stone took the place of wood.
The outer walls of the building are strong, the blocks
and mouldings over the windows and doors are high
and massive, but along with this massiveness, strength,
and permanence, the buildings show a tendency to
run into great height. The pillars are slender, reminding
us of tent-posts; though of more than 60<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
feet in height they have a diameter of only four
feet, and the inter-columniations are often more than
30 feet. The socles and capitals (which are either
the fore-quarters of horses or bulls or inverted
cups) are high and delicate. The socles do not
project far, the capitals are slender; the buildings,
which were covered by roofs of beams, overlaid no
doubt with plates of gold and silver, thus acquired,
along with their solidity, the impression of imposing
elevation and delicate lightness. The sculptures also
are distinguished from those of Babylon and Assyria,
not merely by the fact that they are carried out in
harder material, but they have also greater repose in
the expression, the figures are less compressed, the
muscles less prominent, the development of the forms
more noble and free, the fall of the folds simple and
natural. Animals are represented with extraordinary
vigour and life. The execution in detail is careful,
but flatter and duller than at Nineveh. The expression
of the heads does not possess the energy and
life which the sculptures of Assyria present; even
in the most excited action it is ceremonious. It is
solemn, massive, earnest, dignified, and restrained, but
wanting in character. Beside the sculptures which
symbolically represent the dignity, business, or deeds
of the officers of the empire, the remaining reliefs of
Persepolis give no chronicle of the reign of Darius
and Xerxes; we find neither battles nor sieges; they
merely glorify the splendour and greatness of the
monarchy; they exhibit the throne of the king which
the subject nations carry, surrounded by the princes of
the kingdom, and protected by the body-guard. We
see the subject nations bringing tribute, and thus
we have a picture of established power, and secure
majesty, but not of the individual acts and victories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of the king. The only historical sculpture which is
at present known, is the inscription of Darius at
Behistun. The style is simple and severe, the treatment
far less minute than on the reliefs of Persepolis
and Naksh-i-Rustem, but na&iuml;ve and vigorous.</p>

<p>Susa, so Strabo tells us, was adorned more than
other cities by the kings of the Persians; each built
a separate dwelling there as a memorial of his reign;
after Susa they honoured the palaces of Persepolis
and Pasargadae; at Gabae also in upper Persia and
at Taoke on the coast they had castles.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> From
Xenophon we learn that "the kings of Persia, it is
said, pass the spring and the summer in Susa and
Ecbatana."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> We may conclude from these statements,
and from the fact that the Ach&aelig;menids not only
preserved but multiplied the gold and silver ornaments
of the citadel of Ecbatana, as well as the buildings
of the palace (V. 315), that Susa remained the ordinary
residence even under the successors of Darius, but
that in the height of summer&mdash;in order to avoid the
heat of the plains of Elam&mdash;the court sought the
cooler air of the ancient residence of Phraortes and
Cyaxares&mdash;a change advisable on political grounds also.
Even a short residence in Ecbatana showed that
Media did not occupy the last place in the kingdom.
The Persian kings also resided at times in Babylon.
The Sassanids pursued the same course. Ardeshir built
Shahabad in Elam, his successors resided in Madain,
but during the summer in Hamadan.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The palaces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
in the mother country were visited by Darius and his
successors from time to time, who like himself caused
their sepulchres to be cut either in the rocks of Naksh-i-Rustem,
or on Mount Rachmed, immediately to the
east of the citadel. There are three sepulchres by the
side of that of Darius, and three on Mount Rachmed.</p>

<p>The size and splendour of the palaces at Susa,
Ecbatana, Persepolis, and Pasargadae were matched
by the numbers and brilliance of the court. The
ceremonies and the arrangement of the service were
taken from the pattern of the Median court, but not
without considerable variations, and the Medes, in
turn, had imitated the style of the Assyrian and
Babylonian court. The prominent position of the six
tribal princes, the supreme judges, the "kinsmen and
table companions of the king," were without a parallel
among the Medes; it was they who immediately
surrounded the king next to the occupants of the
great offices of state or honour. It was the opinion
of Cyrus, Xenophon tells us, that the ruler should not
only be superior to his subjects in valour, but he
must exert a charm over them also. Thus he accustomed
both himself and his officers to give commands
with dignity, and for himself and for them he adopted
the Median dress, as being more imposing and majestic.
On solemn occasions the king appeared in a long
purple robe, bordered with white&mdash;such as no one but
himself might wear,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> a Kaftan (Kandys) of brilliant
purple was thrown over it.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The embroidery exhibited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
falcons and hawks, the birds of the good god, which
dwell in the pure air nearest to heaven. This garment
was held together by a golden girdle, in which was
a sabre adorned with precious stones. The trowsers
were of purple; the shoes of the colour of saffron.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
The head was covered by the upright tiara or kidaris,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
of a white and blue colour, or by a band of the same
colours, and also by a crown, as we see from the
picture of Darius on a seal at Behistun.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Plutarch
tells us that the king's attire was valued at 12,000
talents (nearly &pound;3,000,000); his ornaments and attire
on solemn occasions are no doubt meant.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> If the
royal court of the Sassanids was arranged after that
of the Ach&aelig;menids, the attire of the king was even
more extravagant. As the Greeks inform us, the
king of the Persians was a sight seldom seen by the
Persians.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Only the six tribal princes could enter
without being announced. The attempt in any other
person would be punished with death, unless the king
forgave the offence.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> It required time and trouble,
and even special favour, to make way through the
troops of body-guards, servants, eunuchs, under-officers,
and court nobles; and when this was done it was
necessary to be announced by the officers who introduced
strangers, or by the chief door-keeper. The
king sat on a golden throne when he gave audience.
Over this was stretched a baldachino of vari-coloured
purple, supported by four golden pillars adorned with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
precious stones.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> It was the custom among the
Persians for the lower to bow to the earth before the
more honourable,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> no one approached the king without

to the king was compelled to keep his hands hidden
in the long sleeves of his upper garment, in order to
show that he neither could nor would use them.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>According to Xenophon the king of the Persians
at day-break praised the powers of heaven, sacrificed
daily to the gods, whom the Magians indicated.
Plutarch tells us that he was awaked daily
by a chamberlain with the words: "Arise, O king,
and think of the things which Auramazda has given
thee to think of."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> At table the queen-mother and
the queen sat beside him. The first sat above
him, the second below, the king was in the middle
of the table.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Like all the Persians, he ate but
one meal a day, but this lasted a long time. The
princes, the "kinsmen" and "table companions" of
the king, as a rule, ate in an ante-chamber, but
at banquets they were in the same hall with him,
in their proper order, the king on a rich divan with
a golden frame, the companions on pillows or carpets
on the floor,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> so arranged that those whom the king
trusted most were on his left, the others on his right;
"because the king," as Xenophon says, "could in
case of need defend himself better with his right
hand."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Before it was brought to the king the food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
was tested by tasters; and before handing the goblet
to the king, the butler drank a few drops out of it
with a spoon, to prove that it was not poisoned.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
Many kinds of food were set on the table, but
only a moderate portion of each was placed before
every person. Xenophon praises the abstinence of
the well-bred Persians at table; they regarded it as
low and brutish to show desire for food or drink.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
Plutarch says: "Not only the friends, and commanders,
and body-guard of the king had portions
from his table, but also what the slaves and dogs
ate was put upon the board, so that the kings of
the Persians made all who were in their service the
companions of their table and their hearth."<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> What
was left from the table of the king was carried into
the courts and distributed in equal portions among
the body-guard and the servants.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> If the meal was
followed by any drinking, the queen-mother and the
queen retired, before the concubines entered to play
and sing.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The table-companions might not look at
the concubines, and the eunuchs, who brought the
women into the hall, took care that they should not.
Even at night, when the king retired to rest, the
concubines played and sang by the light of burning
lamps.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> On the festival of Mithra, the king was
allowed to dance in Persian fashion, and to be intoxicated;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
on his birthday he gave a great banquet,
which, as Herodotus tells us, was called among the
Persians the perfect banquet. On this day the king
gave presents to the Persians (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> they received a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
largess of money), and at the banquet, in which the
women took part, he could not refuse any petition.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
In accordance with the doctrine of the Avesta the
king celebrated the day which had called him into
life, and, as Plato tells us, all Asia celebrated with
sacrifices and feasts the day which had given them
their ruler.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>No one ever saw the king on foot; if he passed
through the courts of the palace carpets of Sardis
were spread before him, on which no other foot might
step.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Outside the palace the king was sometimes
seen on horseback, but more frequently in his chariot.
It was a much-envied distinction among the princes
of Persia to be allowed to assist the king to his horse.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
If he descended from his chariot, no one might reach
out his hand to support him; it was the duty of the
bearer of the royal stool to place a golden stool for him
to descend. At solemn processions, the roads on which
the royal train passed were cleansed, as in India,
strewn with myrtle and made odorous with frankincense;
a string of guards and whip-bearers were
placed along the way to prevent any one from coming
forward to the chariot of the king.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> The body-guard
in their golden ornaments with crowned tiaras led the
way and brought up the rear. The chariot of Mithra,
yoked with eight Nisaean greys, went before the king;
the sacred fire was carried before him by the Magians;
and beside the chariot of the king, which was drawn
by six or four Nisaean horses, marched staff-bearers.
The chiefs of the tribes, the Ach&aelig;menids, the great
officers of the court, the "kinsmen and table companions"
of the king followed. In the train in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
rear no doubt the royal horses, two or four hundred
in number, were, no doubt, led in splendid trappings.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Darius was married before he ascended the throne
of the Magian. His wife was the daughter of Gobryas,
the chief of the Pateischoreans. She had borne him
three sons before he came to the throne: Artabazanes,
Arsamenes, and Ariabignes.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> When he had acquired
the throne, he made Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus,
his queen, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> his legitimate wife; the younger line
of Ach&aelig;menes was thus yet more closely united with
the elder. The daughter of Gobryas fell into the
rank of the second wives; Atossa took the place
which Cassandane had held beside Cyrus, and which
she herself had previously occupied with Cambyses.
The second daughter of Cyrus, Artystone, and Parmys
the only daughter whom Smerdis had left, passed
into the harem of Darius. Atossa bore him four
sons: Xerxes, Hystaspes, Masistes, and Ach&aelig;menes;
Artystone bore Arsames and Gobryas, and Parmys
Ariomardus. Darius had also sons by other women,
as Phratagune, the daughter of his brother, Artanes;
"he had many sons," is the remark of Justin.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The
secondary wives of the king ranked above the concubines.
The number of the latter was, at any rate
under the successors of Darius, very considerable; it
is given at 300, 350, and 360. After the battle
of Issus, 329 concubines of the last Darius were
discovered among the captives.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> These women, as
Diodorus informs us, were sought out from the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
beautiful maidens in Asia; for the new-comers,
according to the book of Esther, a year's preparation
was necessary. This went on in a special department
of the seraglio, and consisted in the use of ointments,
spices, and perfumes.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> They were so far beneath the
queen, that they were compelled to prostrate themselves
before her when she looked at them;<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> at no
time, except at the table of the king, could they be
seen by men. If they accompanied the king on the
chase or on journeys, and, as became usual at a
later time, to the field, they were always in closed
conveyances. Any one who touched one of the concubines
was put to death, and even any one who
approached their waggons, or passed through the
train.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> The queen enjoyed greater liberty. We are
told of Stateira, the consort of Artaxerxes II., that
she always travelled with her hangings drawn back,
and allowed the women of the people to come up to
her car and greet her.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>We have mentioned already how numerous were
the persons about the court. The Greeks call attention
to the splendid attire of the servants, and
remark that the preparation of the king's table and
the waiting gave them a great deal of trouble: in
fact half the day was taken up with this. Each of
the great court officers had a large number of subordinates.
The chief door-keeper had at his disposal
a number of eunuchs, who watched over the inner
courts of the palace and the harem, waited on
the women and carried messages. The degrading use
of castration was unknown to the nations of the
Arians, and contrary to their religion, which put so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
high a value on life, and the preservation of the
germs of life. It was from the princes of the Semites,
the Assyrian and Babylonian court, that the use of
eunuchs for guarding the harem, for waiting on the
king and his women, and service in the inner
chambers, was borrowed by the Median kings. In
addition to other burdens, Babylonia supplied each
year 500 mutilated boys to Darius. Eunuchs were
never employed in the Persian army for commanders,
or for officers of state, as was the case in Assyria and
Babylonia; but personal attendance on the king,
which even in the time of Cyrus devolved on eunuchs,
brought some of them into favour and influence under
him, and subsequently under Cambyses.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Beside the
chief door-keeper and his eunuchs, was the chief
staff-bearer with his subordinates. It was his duty
to introduce strangers and those who came to ask
for assistance; the envoys from countries and cities;
to preserve order in the palaces, to superintend and
punish the servants. The chief butler was at the
head of a large number of butlers and waiters. The
chamberlains, the valets of the king with their subordinates,
the spreaders of pillows and carpets, the
carvers and table-dressers, the cooks and bakers, the
preparers of ointment, the weavers of crowns, the
lamp-lighters and palace-sweepers formed a considerable
body. In addition there was the chief groom
with his subordinates, the master of the hunt, the
hunters and dog-keepers. Physicians also were at
hand, chiefly from Egypt, who had the greatest
reputation in the east; then came the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Long caravans, surrounded by the body-guard, con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>ducted
the court, when a change of residence was
made, from Susa to the palaces of Persia or Ecbatana.
A large amount of splendid furniture, cattle for
slaughter, food and drink of special quality, were
taken with them. Herodotus tells us that the king
of Persia drank only the water of the Choaspes, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the Kerkha, which was boiled and carried in silver
vessels on four-wheeled cars both into the field, and
on journeys.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Beside numerous waggons the conveyance
of the court required 1200 camels.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Along
with the military equipage of the last Darius 277
cooks, 29 pastry-cooks, 13 preparers of milk diet,
17 preparers of liquors, 70 cellarmen, 40 preparers
of ointment, and 41 chaplet-makers were captured.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

G. G." 1874, s. 173 ff.) has treated exhaustively of the various names
of ancient Elam, as Susiana is invariably called among the Assyrians,
Babylonians, and Hebrews. He proves that the name
&#922;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#943;&#951;
which is in use among the older Greeks, Aeschylus, Hecataeus, and Herodotus,
must be derived from the Kossaeans, a tribe who inhabited the northern
and higher part of Susiana, and the mountainous edge towards Iran.
Of later writers Polybius only uses the name Cissians, who also uses
the name Matieni in the sense of Herodotus. Uwaya, the name common
among the Persians for Susiana, is taken from the Uxians, who were
the eastern neighbours of Persia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the tribe in Susiana which dwelt
nearest to Persia; it is retained in the new Persian Chuz and Chusistan.
Among the Greeks the name Elymaeans is first used by the companions
of Alexander as the name for a tribe, and then in the second century
<small>B.C.</small> as the name of a new kingdom which restored the ancient Elam.
Yet to this tribe which inhabited the plain and the hills of Susa and
Shuster was due the foundation and government of the kingdom
which once ruled in the valley of the Euphrates, which so long
resisted the Assyrians, but was entirely unknown to the Greeks. The
rivers of Susiana are difficult to fix, as both Persian and native names
are indifferently used. The name Choaspes, which contains <i>a&ccedil;pa</i>, is
plainly Persian; it is no doubt the Kerkha. On the Eulaeus, Koprates,
and Pasitigris, see Droysen, "Hellenismus," 1<sup>2</sup>, 266 <i>n.</i></p></div>

systematized arrangement in the "Cyropaedia" that Cyrus spent three
months at Susa, two at Ecbatana, and seven months at Babylon,
which Plutarch ("De Exilio," c. 12) repeats in the form, that the Persian
kings passed the spring at Susa, the summer in Media, and the winter
in Babylon. With Aeschylus and Herodotus Susa is a fixed residence,
and so also in the treatise "De Mundo," p. 398, and the Hebrews,
<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> Nehemiah i. 1. Joseph. "Antiq." 10, 11, 7. Athenaeus, p. 513, thinks
that Persepolis was the residence for the autumn. In the winter of
the year 396-395 Conon finds Artaxerxes II. at Babylon; the same
king says in Plutarch ("Artax." c. 19) to Parysatis, that he will
never see Babylon as long as she lives.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>RETROSPECT.</h3>


<p>The arrangement which Darius had given to his vast
empire allowed the character, laws, manners, and
religion of the subject nations to remain as far as
possible unchanged, and only interfered, exceptionally,
in the hereditary local customs of the provinces. Adequate
provision for the maintenance of the central
government, the establishment of rapid combinations,
care for the training of the generals and officers,
ample and obvious rewards for service, a system of
taxation far removed from extortion, regulations for
the advancement of agriculture, development of the
trade on the southern sea, or by land, since the
caravans could pass unharmed and even protected
from Miletus to Susa, from Cyrene to the Indus,
seemed to give a solid foundation, an adequate support,
and abiding power to the empire of Cyrus and
Darius. Yet for the security and continuance of it,
it was of the first importance, whether the national
feeling of the subject peoples, in spite of or owing
to the tolerance of the empire, was still sufficiently
vigorous and strong to create in them the desire to
rise from the subjection in which they were, to win
back their independence, and develop their national
existence; whether the controlling power of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
ruling people was sufficient to maintain itself for a
length of time over such wide regions; whether, in
fine, the ruling house would preserve, amid the splendour
of its new palaces, and the brilliance of extraordinary
success, the vigour and force required to
sustain the heavy task of administering the empire
in the manner of Darius.</p>

<p>Under his sceptre the national civilizations of Asia
which had hitherto been separated were united into
a great whole. Beside the ancient civilization of
Babylon stood the yet more ancient civilization of
Egypt; beside the Lydians and Syrians, and the
Hellenes of the Anatolian coast, stood the forms of life
existing on the Indus, all united in equal rights;
above these, and yet owing to the formation of this
empire, side by side with them, was the characteristic
civilization of the Bactrians, Medes, and Persians.
The ancient communities of Egypt, Babylonia, and
Phoenicia were able, it is true, to make attempts, and
even stubborn attempts, at resistance, but they did
not succeed in effecting a new departure. On the
contrary, the various forms of civilization united
together began by degrees to exercise a mutual
influence, and each wore down the other. Only the
religious feeling of that Syrian tribe, whose states
had been crushed beneath the armies of the kings
of Asshur and Babylon, remained free from this
assimilation, and self-secluded; in the native soil,
which Cyrus had once more allowed the exiles to
occupy, they struck new and deeper roots, which
promised the noblest fruits from the old sturdy stock.</p>

<p>The Persians, and especially the upper orders, could
not remain uninfluenced by the privileged position
of the ruling people and reigning class in such a
wide empire, and by the pattern of the court. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
fruits of dominion flowed in upon them; their lives
were opulent and full of enjoyment. The Greeks can
tell us a great deal of the splendour and luxury of the
Persians, which were introduced in the time of Darius
and subsequently. They inform us that the Persians
adopted a richer style of dress. Like the Indians,
the Medes and the Persians after them delighted to
adorn themselves; but according to the Greeks the
Persians were even more anxious to give themselves
a dignified and imposing appearance. They wore the
loose dress of the Medes, in blue and red purple;
they also followed the Medes in wearing chains, and
armlets, and earrings of gold.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The hair and beard
received careful attention. In summer the parasol-bearers
were always at hand, in winter gloves were
worn.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The houses were adorned with costly carpets;
the Persians lay on beds with golden feet, and soft
cushions; and on the tables of the higher classes glittered
goblets, bowls, and pitchers of gold and silver.
The servants were numerous, trained butlers, bakers,
and cooks were kept.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The table of the Persians, as the
Greeks tell us, presented but few kinds of farinaceous
food, but whole animals were served up, and the dessert
was plentiful and in various courses.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The hereditary
moderation in wine was not observed. Herodotus tells
us that: "The Persians readily accept foreign customs.
They wear the Median dress because they consider it
more beautiful, and in war they use Egyptian coats
of mail.  They adopt any customs which please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
them, and in addition to a large number of wives,
they have many concubines."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> About the year 500
<small>B.C.</small> the Persians were so accustomed to convenience
in their domestic economy, that they took even into
the field of battle their servants together with their
cooks and maid-servants, their entire harem with
costly furniture, partly in closed waggons and partly
on camels; even the men of the guard were followed
by their women and furniture. The nobles encamped
under tents splendidly wrought with gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
But in spite of this luxury, self-control and military
vigour were never eradicated in the Persians. They
were always seen in a becoming attitude. They were
never observed to eat or drink greedily; they never
laughed loud, or quarrelled, or gave way to passion.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
The education which the sons of the nobles received
under the eye of the king and the satraps, and the
rich rewards in store for eminent valour, kept up a
manly spirit. We have more than one instance of
acts of rare devotion to the king and the empire.
The remembrance of the conflicts of Cyrus, of the
wars which Darius carried on, the consciousness of
great successes, the proud feeling that they governed
the nations of Asia, formed strong counterpoises to
the advance of effeminacy. Even those who lived
most delicately at home eagerly joined in the chase,
in the prescribed extirpation of the animals of Angromainyu,
and the princes did not disdain to do garden-work
with their own hands day by day. At that
time, as Xenophon observes, the old Persian sobriety
and force existed beside the Median dress and luxury,
and Heracleides of Pontus tells us that the Persians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
and Medes, who loved luxury and excess above others,
were also the bravest and most magnanimous of the
barbarians.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Artaxerxes Mnemon, in spite of his golden
ornaments and purple kaftan, dismounted from his
horse, and marched on foot, shield on arm and quiver
on shoulder, day by day at the head of his soldiers,
through the roughest and steepest mountain paths,
though the day's march reached 25 miles or more.
In spite of armlets and purple hose the leading
Persians long after the time of Darius leapt from
their horses into the mud, in order to extricate a
baggage-cart, which prevented the march of the army;
and the common soldier, even when frozen with cold,
hesitated to lay the axe to beautiful trees which
would be consumed merely to warm him by his
watch-fire. The prescripts of religion were not without
effect. The kings kept their word when given;
every Persian regarded it as shameful to break the
pledge of plighted hands, to refuse reverence to his
parents&mdash;his mother especially&mdash;to speak falsely, and
to seek for gains by trade. Thucydides says of them
that they liked better to give than to receive.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> The
pride of the Persians preferred to serve the king with
arms and receive favour and presents from him, than
to carry on any kind of trade. A great number of
the Persians were constantly under arms in the
standing army; the rest tended their flocks and cultivated
their fields in the hereditary way. They kept
to the old Persian dress, the close and short garment
of leather; their coats reached only half way down
the thigh, and instead of the tiara they wore a low
band round the head. Along with their dress and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
mode of life, they kept true to the manners and
moderation of their forefathers, and practised the old
arts of riding and archery.</p>

<p>More serious for the future of the kingdom than
any splendour or magnificence on the part of eminent
Persians, was the influence, which in the composition
of the court was unavoidable, of his personal servants
on the king and on his resolutions&mdash;and the danger
that court intrigues might override the interest of
the empire; above all, the still more unavoidable
influence of the harem. If the position of the queen-mother,
who, in accordance with the doctrines of
Zarathrustra, enjoyed a position of great respect at
court, and her relations to the queen or first wife
gave occasion for jealous rivalry, each secondary
wife had still stronger motives to seek or maintain
influence with the king, to disparage the queen and
the other wives before him, and make provision for
her sons if she could not aspire to gain the succession
to the throne. Thus a door was opened to ambition
and intrigue, and the eunuchs of the wives found in
this occupation only too good an opportunity for
gaining importance and weight. If such evils were
a little matter under a ruler of the determination
and wisdom of Darius, it was impossible to count
on the fact that he would be followed by a series of
kings like himself, and equally great. But if the
court outgrew the state, and the fortunes of the
empire were decided in the seraglio, the empire itself
might be thrown into danger with a change in the
succession. The education given to the princes, and
especially to the heir to the throne, has been mentioned
already, as well as their instruction in the
wisdom of the Magi. The crown descended to the
eldest son of the legitimate wife or queen. Whenever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
the king took the field, in order to prevent contention
he nominated his successor. Even about the successor
of Darius a difficulty might arise. His first wife,
the daughter of Gobryas, had borne him three sons
before he came to the throne; when king, he had
made Atossa his queen, and had four sons by her
(p. 394). Which was the legitimate heir, the eldest
of the first family, or of the second?&mdash;Artabazanes
or Xerxes?</p>

<p>At the death of the king, as Diodorus tells us,
the sacred fire in the royal palace, and in all the
houses of the Persians, was put out.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> We remember
the prescript of the Avesta that the fire of the hearth
must be removed from the house of the dead, together
with all the sacred vessels, the pestle, the cup, the
bundle of rods and the Haoma, and that the fire could
not be kindled again till the ninth or thirtieth day after
the death (V. 215). The heir to the throne repaired
to Pasargadae, to receive consecration from the Magi
there. "In that city," says Plutarch, "there is the
shrine of a warlike goddess who may, perhaps, be
compared with Athene; to this the prince who is
to be consecrated goes, and there lays his robe aside,
in order to put on the garment which Cyrus wore
before he became king: then he eats a cake of dried
figs, bites a terebinth, and drinks a cup of sour milk
(no doubt in remembrance of the old life of the Persians).
Whether he has anything to do beyond this

<p>The Arian tribes of the table-land of Iran have
preserved the original character of their family more
truly than their kinsmen who settled on the Indus
and the Ganges, and filled the Deccan with their
civilization. Placed in a less tempestuous region, in
a land where there were sharp contrasts of climate,
of hill and plain, of fertility and desolation, of snow
and sand storms, the life of the Arians in Iran was
more vigorous and manly than life in India. The
tribes in the north-east attained to civic life and
intellectual progress before the tribes of west Iran.
The contrast in which the former stood to the hordes
of the neighbouring steppes, and the repulsion of their
attacks, led the Bactrians to a larger state, and the
formation of a military monarchy, which arose from
the midst of an armed nobility, while the weight of
the ancient and powerful states of the Semites in the
valley of the Euphrates and the Tigris, repressed the
independent development of the tribes of western
Iran. The foundations of the religious views of the
Arians were the same to the east and west of the
Indus. With the Arians of the Panjab, the Arians of
Iran shared the belief in the power of the spirits of
light which gave life and blessing, in the destructive
power of the black spirits, and the struggle of the
spirits of light against the spirits of darkness. The
peculiar intensity of the contrasts in nature and in
the conditions of life in the north-east, gave an
impulse to the development of religious views there,
which led to the systematic opposition of the hosts
of heaven and of hell, and the union of these groups
under two supreme spirits, and to deeper ideas of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
their nature. It was a transformation of the old
conceptions which at the same time carried with it a
change and increase in the ethical demands made
upon men. While the development of conceptions
beyond the Indus tended to set man free from all
sensuality, and sought to bring him back to his
divine origin, by crushing the body and quenching
the individuality, the doctrine of Zarathrustra excludes
only the harmful side of nature, and demands the
increase of the useful side; it pledges every man to
take a part in the conflict of the good spirits against
the evil, demands that by his work, his activity, and
the purity of his soul, he enlarge the kingdom of
the good and light spirits to the best of his ability,
and thus forms sound and practical aims for the
conduct of men. When this doctrine had penetrated
to the nations of west Iran, and struck deep roots
among them, the Medes succeeded in combining their
tribes, and repelling the supremacy of the Assyrians.
In no long time the borders of their dominion extended,
in the west to the Halys, and in the east
over the whole table-land of Iran; in union with
Babylon they overthrew the remnant of Assyria, and
shared with that city the empire over Hither Asia.
What the Medes had begun, the Persians finished,
when they had taken the place of the Medes. One
after another the ancient kingdoms of Hither Asia
fell before them&mdash;the Lydian empire, which had
finally united under its sway the tribes and cities of
the western half of Asia Minor, ancient Babylon,
which had once more united the valley of the two
streams, the states of Syria, and the cities of the
Phenicians, and at length even primeval Egypt.</p>

<p>Arian life and Arian culture were now dominant
through the whole breadth of Asia, from the pearl-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>banks
and coral-reefs of the Indian Ocean to the
Hellespont. At the time when the first Arian settlers
were landing far in the east on Tamraparni (Ceylon)
the cities of the Hellenes on the western coast of
Anatolia and the strand of the Aegean were compelled
to bow before the arms of Cyrus. The world had
never seen before such an empire as that of Darius,
the borders of which reached from the Libyans, the
plateau of Barca, the Nubians and negroes beyond
Egypt, the tribes of the Arabian desert to the summits
of the Caucasus, the remote city of Cyrus on the
Jaxartes, and the gold-land of the Daradas in the
lofty Himalayas. And not contented with this range
Darius aspired to extend yet further the limits of
his empire.</p>

<p>Beyond the Aegean Sea a branch of the Arian stock
had developed an independent civilization and civic
life in small mountain cantons surrounded by the
sea. The eye of the potentate of Asia looked no doubt
with contempt on these unimportant communities,
whose colonies in Asia and Africa had long been
subject to him; on states of which each could put
in the field no more than a few thousand warriors.
The sea, which separated the Persian kingdom from
the cantons of the Greeks, had already been crossed;
the Persians had seen the mouths of the Danube;
the straits of the Bosphorus and the Hellespont were
in the power of Darius, the coasts of Thrace and the
Greek states were subject to him; he had already
planted a firm foot at the mouths of the Hebrus and
the Strymon, and the prince of Macedonia paid him
tribute. At his command Phenicians and Persians
had investigated the coasts of the Aegean Sea, and
of Hellas.</p>

<p>Was it possible that these small cantons, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
political union or common interests, living in perpetual
strife and feud, excited and torn by internal
party contests in which there were almost as many
views as men, whose exiles made their way to the
lofty gates of the Persian monarch, whose princes were
at pains to secure their dominions by vassalage to the
great king, and join in leagues with him against
their countrymen&mdash;was it possible that these cantons,
in this position, would maintain their independence
against Persia, and resist the attack of this universal
empire,&mdash;the onset of Asia? Would the Greeks be
bold enough to venture on such a hopeless struggle,
to oppose the Persians, whose name was a terror to
all their neighbours, and even to the Hellenes? Few,
Herodotus tells us, could even bear the sight of the
Persian cavalry, and Plato remarks that the minds
of the Greeks were already enslaved to the Persians.</p>

<p>It was a question of decisive importance for the
civilization and development of humanity; whether
the new principle of communal government, which
had been carried out in the Hellenic cantons, should
be maintained, or pass into the vast limits of the
Persian empire, and succumb to the authority of the
king: state power and civic life, absolute authority
and the will of the majority, abject obedience and
conscious self-control, the masses and the individual&mdash;these
were ranged opposite each other, and the
balance was already turning in favour of overwhelming
material force.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
